"In recent years, many places all around the world have taken the intiative to lower the use of motor-vehicles, specifically cars, with the intent of decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted into the air. There are various actions being taken in this attempt, with some neighborhoods going as far as eliminating the use of their cars completely. No matter what actions are being taken, the real goal is to improve the planet and the quality of the air that we are breathing.

As mentioned before, one of the main goals of limiting car use is to improve our air by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being put into it. If you are driving your car to and from work every single day, and you live in a city where your house/apartment is about 10 minutes away, don't you think you could ride your bike every now and then? Even if you don't have a bike, you could try taking the bus, or maybe even a taxi. By riding your bike, you are eliminating the chance of putting out any greenhouse gases, and by taking the bus, you are reducing the amount of gas being put out.

Aside from improving the environment by limiting car use, you can also improve yourself. Instead of driving your car everyday, you can ride your bike to where you need to go (as previously suggested), and in turn get a small workout. Riding your bike works your muscles, especially your leg muscles, gets your blood pumping, and even reduces stress. If you start riding your bike, you could improve your health and just feel better overall. You can also avoid sitting in a stuffy car and breathe in some fresh air.

In the end, limiting car use seems to have more pros than cons, so it's easy to see why so many places/people have jumped on board with the idea. Even if cars weren't harsh on the environment, they're still bulky and expensive, being more of a hassle than anything else. Why wouldn't you want to limit their use?",0,1
"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",0,1
"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",0,1
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",0,1
