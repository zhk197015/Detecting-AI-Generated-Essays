"Dear Senator,

I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe that having an Elecotral college vote helps the President have a greater chance of becoming elected. This process also makes it a fair game of becoming elected for President.It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.

As I mentioned before, having and electoral votes makes it fair game for everyone. It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When no candidate wins a majority of the vast cast, it causes complications in the presidential election process. That's when the Electoral College steps in and prodices a clear winner.

Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may not be the best way of geting potential voters for a candidate, but the way they do things makes it fair game. It keeps the system balanced. The Electoral College is an established compromise in the Constitution brought on by the Founding Fathers. It's something original that I think should live on instead of being taken away. The Electoral College should stay.

"phones and driving

How many of you own a cell phone? And how many of you have used your cell phone while driving? The second we hear the ring of an incoming call or the beep of a text message, we instinctively reach for our phone to answer. But while driving, that may not be the wisest decision. For those of you that do not use your cell phone while driving, then I would like to thank you, because by resisting your phone, you could be saving a life. That is a powerful statement, but it is true.

Cell phone use while driving is dangerous. In Houston Texas, a father of five children veered of the road into the Green Bayou River. The father had his five children in the car when he veered off the road in the river. The reason for his reckless driving, he was distracted because he answered an incoming cell phone call. This tragic accident could've been prevented if the father had simply ignored his phone when it was ringing.

Accidents such as this are happening more frequently because people are talking and texting on their cell phones rather than paying attention to the road. To prevent our loved ones from becoming victims, like the five innocent children who lost their lives in Houston, we must support the banning of cell phone use in cars and make the choice to put down our own cell phones when we are driving. Better yet, let's turn them off when we get in the car and turn them back on when we arrive at our destination.

As you can see, driving while using a cell phone is unsafe and may result in serious and even deadly consequences. It is so dangerous that cell phone use in the car is compared to drunk driving or driving under the influence of drugs. If you think about it, in both situations the driver's awareness is altered. I am going to give you three reasons why cell phone use should be banned. The first reason why cell phone use should be banned is because it is very distracting. When we are talking on the phone or texting while driving, our attention is on our phone rather than the road. Secondly, this distraction had caused numerous car accidents that have resulted in deaths and seriously injured people. The third and final reason that cell phone use should be banned in cars is because cell phone users are reckless as drunk drivers. Since accidents are occurring more frequently, cell phone users are being compared to drunk drivers due to the recklessness of their driving and lack of awareness.",0,1
"What is the best leaning environment? Working in groups or working alone? Some people like to work in groups and others like to work alone. Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they don't feel uncomfortable towards other people.

First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other.

Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they don't feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed. They won't feel uncomfortable or awkward by other people because some people don't like meeting or being with people. Most of them just want to be alone or with people they might know.

All in all, find what you feel more comfortable with it could be being alone or being in a group to study with people you might want to get to know or with your friends that your comfortable with. Working alone is the best choice for most people because they might be able to work faster, they are fully concentrated in their own hard work and they might just feel comfortable with themselves.",0,1
"Dear Florida state senator,

I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I argue for keeping the Electoral College because of several reasons backed up with information.

Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Electoral College makes it so that larger states don't have larger influence than smaller states. If the Electoral College is removed then larger states shall have much more political power than smaller states. Which means that a small state might not get the same amount of attention from presidential candidates as a larger state would like Florida.

Secondly, the Electoral College avoids Run-off Elections in which no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It avoids that problem because candidates can win Presidency by electoral votes instead of popularity vote. For example, Nixon and Clinton didn't have the majority of the popular votes, but they still won because of electoral votes. If the Electoral College hadn't exist then elections might be more frustrating for everyone, because the Electoral College makes a certainty of outcome.

Thirdly, the Electoral College makes sure that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. This is good because a candidate with only regional appeal is probably not going to be a very good president. And besides without the Electoral College there would be many presidents with regional appeal wich would make other states feel left out, and this could be catastrophic to the unity of America.

In conlcusion, despite the Electoral College isn't exactly of democratic origins, it still equalizes the political power of states, makes sure that candidates have trans-regional appeal and avoids run-off elections. Overall I say that the Electoral College is very important in keeping how we choose our president balanced and smooth.",0,1
"Some people believe that glorifying a student's work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a student's work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves.

One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a student's work will help them to be self-consident.

Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort.

Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem.

In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",0,1
"In recent years, many places all around the world have taken the intiative to lower the use of motor-vehicles, specifically cars, with the intent of decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted into the air. There are various actions being taken in this attempt, with some neighborhoods going as far as eliminating the use of their cars completely. No matter what actions are being taken, the real goal is to improve the planet and the quality of the air that we are breathing.

As mentioned before, one of the main goals of limiting car use is to improve our air by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being put into it. If you are driving your car to and from work every single day, and you live in a city where your house/apartment is about 10 minutes away, don't you think you could ride your bike every now and then? Even if you don't have a bike, you could try taking the bus, or maybe even a taxi. By riding your bike, you are eliminating the chance of putting out any greenhouse gases, and by taking the bus, you are reducing the amount of gas being put out.

Aside from improving the environment by limiting car use, you can also improve yourself. Instead of driving your car everyday, you can ride your bike to where you need to go (as previously suggested), and in turn get a small workout. Riding your bike works your muscles, especially your leg muscles, gets your blood pumping, and even reduces stress. If you start riding your bike, you could improve your health and just feel better overall. You can also avoid sitting in a stuffy car and breathe in some fresh air.

In the end, limiting car use seems to have more pros than cons, so it's easy to see why so many places/people have jumped on board with the idea. Even if cars weren't harsh on the environment, they're still bulky and expensive, being more of a hassle than anything else. Why wouldn't you want to limit their use?",0,1
"The limitation of human contact has been a negative effect in peoples lives; people are so caught up in today's technology that no one really talks in person anymore. People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

Most people feel like technology has a good effects when it mostly doesn't. Technology is mostly a bad thing because people decide to date each other through text rather than in person and people communicate mostly through text. People need to go out into the world and talk to new people. Everyone needs to see the difference in the real world rather than through text.",0,1
"Today in society cell phones play a huge part in deaths because people use their cell phones while driving because they want to text, call, take pictures, and or even being on social media. As people continue to depend on cellphones for their communication needs these devices not only become more useful but also more dangerous, especially when people are using their phones at the wrong times. The most dangerous time to use your phone is when you are driving. If you use your phone while you are driving, you are taking a huge risk on losing your life or taking someone else's life. The action of many countries around the world to ban the use of cell phones while driving may have served to deter drivers from using their phones as they drive.

One of the main reasons that make using cell phones while driving very dangerous is that using the cell phone reduces a driver's reaction time in traffic. On busy roads, the amount of time that one talks before reacting to a situation in most cases determines whether someone gets to continue living. It is very dangerous to text and call while driving but texting while driving is more dangerous because the driver must constantly keep looking at the phone screen in order to type or read the messages. Studies show that people who text while driving tend to accelerate more slowly after stepping on the brakes, this can cause irregularities for another driver leading to possible accidents and since their eyes are more on the text than the road, drivers who choose to text while driving have a much higher chance of hitting a pedestrian than those not distracted in driving.

Many accidents, whether severe or not, usually occur within a blink of an eye. This means that just a moment of distraction is enough for a driver to cause a serious road accident. Given the many concerns, it is best if drivers were not only banned from texting but banned from their phones in any way at all as they drive.",0,1
"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies. ",0,1
"Venus is one, if not the most interesting planet in our solar system. Next to Mars, and the moon, we have put all of our scientific power into studying this very strange yet interesting planet. At one point in time along the scale of our vastly universe, Venus had the closest living conditions to our home, Earth. The planet has mountains, valleys, and space material impacts. Venus is so fascinating and important to us that we, as a race, are willing to put our lives in danger to explore the unknown planet.

In the passage it says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The meaning behind this sentence showcases that we should not be afraid or unwilling to explore the unknown just because we are scared of what we do not know that is out there. We can not stay on Earth forever. The planet is going to die eventually. We also have concerns of natural resources, over-population, and food density. Which indefinitly means that we need to find a new suitable planet for us, as a race, to strive and survive.

If we do not adapt and overcome our stay on Earth we are smuthering and destroying all the hard work, as a race, that we have put to this planet. Just like in nature, animials are forced to moved from their natural habitats and have to adapt to just simply survive. If we can not do the same we will end up with a much more impactful, dangerous situation. That's what we, as a race, strive on is knowing the unknown. In conclusion, we must always be evolving and adapting to stay ahead of the game.",0,1
"I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform. It may look like a face but it is really not. What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",0,1
"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people's vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress Source One. People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it's a more fair system.

As citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It's important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it's also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It's very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness Source Two. Source Three also states that ""that trust is rarely betrayed,"" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.

Overall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country's people being misrepresented Source Two. Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source Two. The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.

The popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and ""swing"" states have over others. Currently, ""swing"" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states Sources Two and Three. Since the Swing states are the ones who's votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electorsrepresentatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.

All in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It's important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there's no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.",0,1
"In this day and age, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things.Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a carfree lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconceived notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only costeffective, but it also dramatically decreases greenhouse gas emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the nonrenewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very costeffective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs 40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, gas, tolls, and repairs that come with being a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to give up a small amount of convenience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to get to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, humanpowered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accommodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse gases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in leiu of driving and reduces the amount of cars on te road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small inconvience caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized.",0,1
"Actress and singer Audrey Hepburn once remarked, ""Nothing is impossible. The word itself say I'm possible!"" The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" agrees. They claim that although venturing to a planet that is seeminly un-explorable is dangerous, it is also a worthwhile and necessary mission. By justifying why it is crucial to continue our efforts to explore Venus, and additionally through their explanation as to how this can safely be accomplished, the author of this article strongly supports their idea that studying Venus is a noble pursuit despite the many obstacles that it creates.

One way that the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their claim is by explaining the sheer value and benefit of going to Venus. While it is true that several conditions on Venus' surface are inhospitable and unable to support or sustain human life, the author claims that ""astronomers are fascniated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (para 4). This might lead to discoveries that could help us understand or predict Earth's future evolution patterns. Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as ""Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,"" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our ""nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree.

Additionally, the author supports his/her claim by revealing how a mission to Venus can be carried out in a safe, mannerly way. This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' ""conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,"" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level. The author also disscusses other potential solutions, such as possibly using silicon carbide, a material that has ""been tested in a chmaber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and [has] lasted for three weeks in such conditions,"" (7). These all are possible ways to make a trip to Venus much safer and, more importantly, they all help support the author's claim.

Overall, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus. After all, like Hepburn says, the word does state ""I'm possible!""",0,1
"Sometimes I find myself stuck and confused over some of the smallest things. Typically I am debating over which decision would lead to the best outcome. I strongly believe that having many peoples opinions to consider is always helpful. Asking more experienced people, having good and bad things to think about , and getting many different opinions are all ways to make decision making easier.

When it comes to asking people for advice, most of the time the more advice I get, the better. Having multiple opinions to think about is better than just one. There are many pros and cons for everything and asking many people for advice will help to point those pros and cons out. When I have everyone's advice to think about, it allows me to think about all of the good and bad things that could happen based on the choice I make.

In addition to that, talking to many people for advice on something helps me see from their point of view. Sometimes I don't realize how big or small the situation I'm in actually is. When I take a moment to look at the situation from a different prospective, it helps me to be more open minded. Sometimes we all get so distracted and don't realize how much our decisions could affect others. Taking a moment to see something from someone else's point of view wouldn't be such a bad idea.

Not only should we ask others for advice, but asking others who happen to be experienced is never a bad idea. Some people specialize in certain topics and asking someone who knows a lot about something could be very beneficial. Many times I have asked my older brother for help with things like my phone or the television, because when it comes to technology he has always been very helpful. Often times adults are the best people to ask for advice from because they are very experienced at life.

In conclusion, I believe that asking for advice from many people will always help. Also asking more than one person and seeking many different opinions to help make the best choice is always a good idea. It's never a bad idea to rethink choices based on other peoples advice.",0,1
"Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile device use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.

In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones.

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done",0,1
"Decisions, Decisions

Nothing is worse than a problem that requires you to choose between multiple things. Sometimes you need a little guidance so you can stay on the right course. We can't view asking for help or advice as a weakness. We first need to observe the benefits. Wisdom, different perspectives and satisfaction are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions is so great.

Wisdom plays a big role in decision making.

There are people that have been through what you are going through, and can give you sound advice. This advice can be better than normal advice because not only do they understand the situation, they probably know what you've been going through on top of that. These people have learned from mistakes they have made, and know how to avoid them. Seeking an opinion from someone with experience will always be a sound decision.

We often count out people with opinions that aren't similar ours, but we fail to realize the reason for varying perspectives.

When faced with a decision to make, no matter how small, our judgment can become clouded.

To another person who isn't dealing with that problem at first hand, things look a little clearer for them.

They can provide an unbiased opinion that you probably needed.

These people can also open you up to ideas that you hadn't even considered.

When it's all said and done, sometimes we don't end up with the outcome we would have preferred. But knowing that you tried the hardest you could and exhausted every possible resource leaves you with a slight satisfaction. Seeking out multiple opinions may not have gotten you what you wanted, but you can move forward with this new information feeling better about yourself, and better about the future.

With all this new information, you can now face your problem head-on and know just what to do. We've established that there are a multitude of benefits to seeking multiple different opinions.

Wisdom, different perspectives, and satisfaction.

Its now up to you to decide if utilizing this info is in your best interest. Making decisions can be tough but that's just my advice.",0,1
"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.

Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.

In conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",0,1
"I would first remind them that when the face on Mars was first shown in a picture, we did not have the greatest technology. This tells us that we cannot assume any thing in the picture to be definite because things may be blurred. This is not a major point to go on, but it is just the beginning.

Next, I would explain that messas are very common on Mars and that the shadows are the only factor that are actually giving an illusion of a face. This strays from from their belief that the face on Mars was created or planted there.

After that, I would simply point out that clearer pictures and better evidence have proven the face on Mars to be ""a huge rock formation....formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Also, Hollywood has been known to dazzle the mind with some unlikely but fascinating thoughts. Such as the many movies aout the face on Mars pointing the attention to aliens to gain more supporters and the good ratings from the audience. It is basically science fiction. They only provide a perspective from which the human mind can comprehend imagination. Imagining is good, but not with false hope. Books, magazines, and talk shows will do the same thing for similar reasonS. And other propositions from ordinary people for this face on Mars have surely been made over the last twenty-five years.

These things point to the fact that the face is merely a coincidence in a messa formation.",0,1
"The Electoral College is a process which is between a election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the popular vote of qualified citizens. Why do we need the Electoral College? We need the Electoral College to see what the people want in their opinion. Also, we need it for the problems the Electoral College avoids us from, such as each candidate doesn't recieve a majority of the votes cast.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, that wouldn't be fair. The people of the smaller states fell that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no sense of caring for their interests,like he really isn't their president. The bigger states, such as Texas, restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. So, as we can see a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state would.

Next, the Electoral College avoids us from things in many ways. For example, Nixon in 68' and Clinton in 92' both had a 43 percent chance plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Which means that pressure, which would greatly confuse the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which clearly states the winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president could turn off potential voters that has no hope for carrying their state. So the Electoral College greatly avoids run-off elections.

Therefore, we shall keep the Electoral College in favor for why we need to have it, and how it helps us avoid big situations. So please, let us keep the Electoral College as it helps our country throough political situations and for how it helps us.",0,1
"Well, if i'm being honest with you. I do not believe it is a good thing to do. In certain states, yes. But when it comes to school and kids' education? No. If you put these kinds of computers in schools, all they would do is distract the kids and make them focus on what the computer is doing itself instead of the work. Sure, it can read when you're bored or unhappy. But that doesn't mean it's alright to distract the kids from doing their work.

Alright, so i think it's cool that a computer can tell emotions and how you are feeling and this and that. But in all reality it is just another electronic thing that we do not need in the world. Every year, people and companies come out with more and more stupid ideas for electronics. All i am hearing on TV anymore is about the new iPhones or the new Mac Books. They are cool and all, but you literally just came out with a new one last year. Like it says in the story, ""Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.""

In conclusion, these new tech designs and programs and electronics are pointless and unuseable. There is no point in putting something in a school that will just distract the kids from learning. Maybe having them at popular restaurants and stuff would help. But in schools? No way. Kids nowadays have a hard enough time learning in school, putting these computers in the schools is not going to help them learn anything quicker.",0,1
"The electoral college has many inherent flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttal to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unnecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes tenfold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.",0,1
"When we're having difficulty deciding what to do,we turn to someone in hopes of them giving us advice. For example, when you're at a resturant and you don't know what to get, you ask somebody else what they believe is a good option. Sometimes, you may even ask more than one person. Asking for more opinions from different people can lead to better choices. When asking for advice, think about the type of person they are, what kind of experience they had, and what option would be best for you.

There are many different types of people in this world. Some can be quiet and introverted; others can be loud and outgoing. When you're taking advice from somebody, consider: their personality, what they like, and what they don't like. Imagine you're deciding whether or not to go to a concert. If you ask someone who doesn't like them if you should go or not, they're most likely tell you no. If you ask someone who likes concerts, they're more likely to say yes. What they belive you should do all depends on what type of person they are and what they'd personally enjoy.

Last summer, my mom signed my brothers up for a summer camp. One enjoyed it because his friends were in the same group as him. However, my other brother hated it because he didn't like the people he was grouped with.

When I asked if I should go, if it would be fun, only one said yes. The different experiences they both had made them have different opinions about the camp as a whole.

Lastly, when asking for advice, the most important thing is to ask yourself is, ""Is this something I actually want to do?"" When considering your options, it all comes down to choosing what's right for you. Sometimes, asking multiple people for their opinion can leave you confused and even more frustrated than before. If you get to this point, think about the pros and cons of each choice. Decide whether or not it's the best option or if there's a better one for you.

All in all, hearing opinions from multiple people can help you make a better choice because it helps you narrow down the pros and cons. Everyone is a different person and everyone has different experiences. Getting advice from many people is an important part in problem-solving. It helps you find solutions to minor problems- like what to eat for dinner, and it can help you find solutions to greater problems- whether you should move houses or not. Sure, hearing advice from many people can be frustrasting, but it can also change your life for the better.",0,1
"Texting and driving puts innocent lives at risk every day, Higher risk than drunk drivers. However, some people feel that creating a law against phone usage is violating personal rights. Others feel that banning someone from using their cell phones is equivalent to telling someone that they can't adjust their radio or talk to someone else in their car. However, using a phone, whether talking or texting, while driving can be dangerous to your family or friends in the car including you and the people of your surroundings. All of the damage you could cause and all that has been caused in the past can and still could be avoided by simply pulling over. There are so many places to stop over and relax while you drink something and respond to the text where it is safe. If everyone turned their phone off before getting in the car, then there would be no worries about feeling the urge or need to pick up the phone and risk lifes. Research shows that while on the phone, crash risk quadruples.

Well-enforced traffic laws have been a highly effective countermeasure for reducing risky driving behaviors and the associated crashes, deaths, and injuries. However, it is not clear that laws limiting drivers' cellphone use are having the same beneficial effects. The research on the effects of driver cellphone and texting bans found mixed results. Even though the law has passed people are still going to text and drive but it helped a little and scared a few younger people being a law.",0,1
"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",0,1

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus.

First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture. When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.

Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us. While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.

Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus. When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.

Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.",0,1
"Often times, when we're looking for advice we talk to multiple people, why is that? When your looking for advice or a solution to a problem, do you talk to more than one person? If so, did that lead to a better result? In my experience talking to multiple people about a problem proved to be a good idea. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of people's experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.

First off, one reason why you should seek multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice are people's experiences. People's experiences shape who they are, and determine how they respond to certain situations. Different people have different experiences, leading to different responses. Someone who has ran into your situation before will most likely give better advice than someone who's never been in that situation. People tell you to respect your elders because of all the experiences they've had, older people probably have a lot of solutions to problems you may have.

Secondly, another reason why you should talk to multiple people about a situation are perspectives. Every person has an unique perspective, influenced by their past experiences or current situation. For example, if two people went to the store, a three year old and a twenty one year old, their perspectives would be very different. Everybody looks at a situation from a different perspective, and that can prove useful when you're looking for advice. The way someone comprehends a situation can be heavily influenced by their perspective.

Lastly, there are people's backgrounds. Someone's background is made up of many different things including ethnicity, religion, or culture. Across cultures situations can be interpreted and handled differently, so someone's background can impact their interpretations of situations or problems. All this can lead to advice you wouldn't get from your own background. Someone's background plays a role in the first to things I mentioned, experience and perspective. People's unique backgrounds can give them unique experiences and perspectives, that might differ from your own.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to seeking multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice, and there are many things that can have an impact on the advice people may give you. If you didn't ask others for advice, you would only have your own knowledge to deal with your problems, instead of the world of knowledge at your disposal. I believe you should seek opinions from multiple people because of people's unique experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.",0,1
"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.

The first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.

Although using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.

In addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.

In conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This changes is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.",0,1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing this letter to inform you of how I think changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be better than keeping the electoral college. Back in 1960, in the Louisana legislature, segragations nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Occasionally, electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state. With an electoral college it's the electors who elect the president, not the people. The Electoral College method of selecting the president can turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to exspress a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.",0,1
"I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards the electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the persidential election, your governor prepares a ""

Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as a part of the official records of the presidential election.

The Electorial Collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. They avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the casts.",0,1

"Dear, State Senator

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral college. i am in favor of keeping Electoral college because it was the original decision made by our founding fathers. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the elctoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to  the District of columbia..

most states have a ""winner-takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidates.

but people  like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO think that we should abolish the electoral college.

although i am in favor of it, there are some disadvantages to electoral college. under the electoral college system, voters vote for a a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst.",0,1
"Would you let students read eachothers emotions in a classroom? I will be addressing why this may be valuble to students, or even to the whole school and why it may not be valuble.

The first thing i want to talk about is how it can be benificial to the Students. What if your close friend or even a teacher isn't acting their usual self. You can't quite figure out what the cause may be with them. And instead of asking, you could see what their emotion is through technology. If it shows up that they're sad you can figure out a way to encourage them to talk about whats going on. Or you can just figure out a way to cheer them up with out knowing their personal life. Or you could see if the person is just plain tired. So checking their emotions can also help you to understand that it may not even be you. They may be exhausted after a long day. So then you learn not to take things so personal.

A reason it may not be Valuble is people just need privacy. Maybe someone is upset over something personal that has happened in their life. I feel like if you do use the techology on the wrong person, it could set them off and lead them to being more irritable. Some people like to handle their emotions in different ways. Even if that means doing it in peace with no interuptions.

In conclusion, I feel that it depends on the situation in a school or town. It depends if you actually know the person, or if the person likes to be left alone or not. Everyone deserves privacy. So if schools were to do so, I suggest getting contracts to see who would be up for it and who wouldn't",0,1
"The era of personal mobile transportation may be coming to an end. Many cities all over the world have taken part in a ""car-free day"". Residents of an experimental suburb in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to participate in a movement called ""smart planning"", a developing trend in Europe. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gases.

With countries all over the world taking part in the percentage of greenhouse gases in the air, it is vital we all unite to clear up the air for our future generations.

In Bogota, Columbia, people are ending their car-dependent lives and participating in events such as the ""Day Without Cars"". The goal of this event is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" according to Andrew Selsky's article in the

Seattle Times.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated: ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"".

So what are the advantages of limiting car usage? According to Selsky's article, the city of Bogota, Columbia have replaced ""uneven, pitted sidewalks"" with ""broad, smooth sidewalks""; ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic""; ""and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". But what exactly does that mean for the world and our everyday lives?

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" according to Heidrun Walter from Vauban, Germany, featured in an article by Elisabeth Rosenthal in the

New York Times.

Citizens like Heidrun Walter may feel less tense and happier. Also, smog and traffic will be cut drastically if citizens gave up their car-dependent lives.

In a way our lives may be more simple and healthy if we walked, rode a bike, or even rollerbladed to school/work. The smog would clear up and our everyday lives would be greater than before.",0,1
"Quite often, we find ourselves needing advice on things we don't know much about. On certain occasions, we search for more than one person for it. People may end up gaining multiple viewpoints from doing such, as well as grasping a better understanding on a matter. They may also think their final decisions over more thoroughly.

When multiple people are questioned about a matter, it's not all likely for all of them to have the same viewpoints. In that way, someone looking for advice from multiple people could possibly gain a more unbiased and logical opinion. From an unbiased standpoint, someone could see a situation with an open minded view.

Questioning multiple people for advice often gives more information on the topic itself. When more is known, it's practical for someone to feel less confused than they may have been before they began asking others for help and advice. One may also feel more at ease with knowing more than less.

A person who may not know how to handle a certain situation may become stressed from the lack of knowledge and experience. With acquired information and opinion, it generally becomes easier to ponder over a situation at hand. While knowing the pros and cons, someone could figure a decision that would be best for them and others involved, if anyone at all.

From derived information one could obtain by looking at multiple views, one could gain more knowledge, peace, and less bias overall. In conclusion, it would be a better idea to search advice on situations from multiple people, if possible, than over a singular individual, to avoid bias.",0,1
"They say Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Its a crucial consideration given the long time frames of spave travel. The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0,1
"Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". Shadows on the object give ""the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.

The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.",0,1
"So, I was walking down the street the other day, in my NASA uniform, when a conspiracy theorist stops me to ask me a few questions about the Face on Mars. ""Sir, I am with the Conspiracy Theorist League, or the CTL. I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the supposed Face on Mars. My coworkers and I think that the Face is a remnant of an alien civilization. We would like to hear your opinion on the subject."" ""Well,"" I began begrudgingly, because these guys had no idea what the Face really is. ""The face is really just a mesa whose shadows made it look like a face at first glance."" I said. ""Really?"" The CTL representative says. ""How fascinating. The real question, though, is what proof do you have that you are not lying to us."" ""Well, for one thing, NASA wouldn't benefit from the keeping the discovery of aliens away from the population. Two, our images have shown us that the face is really just a hill, nothing more, nothing less. Also, the Face is in an area that is full of mesas just like it, so it would be absurd to think that the Face is anything but a mesa."" ""Alright then, thank you for your time."" The CTL representative says as he walks away.",0,1
"The United States has always had people complaining about the Electoral College, and that's exactly what I'm about to do.  I think that the Electoral College was probably a good idea at first, but it's not very helpful for the elections.  The Electoral College, as you know, has people from every state, some states having more on it than others based on the population.  It's not right to have a few people have just as big of a say as hundreds of thousands of people.

I read from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" and learned that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote from the people, but then lost the election because the Electoral College voted against him.  That means that the president was not picked based on who the people of this country wanted, but who only a small amount of people wanted.  How does that make any sense at all? There's no way to defend that.  If it's OUR country, WE should be the ones voting for who we want to lead us, not a couple of people who think they're more important than the rest of the population that votes.

What happens if there's a tie in the Electoral College?  We're going to take it to the House of Representatives?  That means ONE person will be representing their whole entire state's vote.  How safe is that?  I'm sure if it comes down to it and we have to do that, there's going to be a lot of people who aren't happy.  It doesn't even make sense to have one person have as much say as their whole state put together.

There are some good things about the Electoral College, though. I admit the Electoral College would be good when the people's votes are close or maybe even tie, but how often is that going to happen?  I think it's also smart that when you vote for who you want to be president, you also vote for their electors.  That's much better than having to vote for a president and the electors separately.  It'd be much easier though if we got rid of electors all together.

It's kind of like when you're at a crossroads.  You and someone else get there at the same time.  They're to your right, so they have the right of way and can go first.  It doesn't matter that you got there at the same exact time, or even if you're going somewhere more important than where they're going.  It's like that with the election.  The Electoral College and the state may both be voting, but the Electoral College has the ""right of way"" and has more importance over us, whether they care who they're voting for or not.

The Electoral College was made a long time ago by people that some will argue were a lot smarter than us, but as times change, so should rules.  I don't think it was a dumb idea, it seems smart as a whole, but I just don't think when you actually put it in use it's fair.  When you cast your vote, you want it to mean something, but if someone else exactly like you happens to be one of the electors for the College and votes for someone else, their vote is a lot more important.

There's a lot to be said about the Electoral College... Both good and bad, but in the end there isn't much anyone who is normal and whose vote barely counts for anything can do.  We can say how bad it is however much we want.  We can throw at you facts upon facts about how unnecessary or unfair the Electoral College is.  In the end, it's up to the government to decide what will happen, as it always has been.

To sum it all up, the Electoral College isn't a smart way to help decide who should be president. This is the United States of America, it's for the people and made by the people, so why on Earth should they not be able to be the only ones to pick who will run them as a country?

Please take into consideration everything I have said.  Thank you.",0,1
"I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.

My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.

My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",0,1
"It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns. Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during next two decades. The trend of using cell phones has increased throughout the world. One of the primary reasons for the gigantic growth of cell phones is that they facilitate communication offering high levels of flexibility reaching desired person within seconds whether he/she is at office, home, or outside driving a car etc. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectively and without wastage of any time. Other main reason for the explosive growth of cell phones is the safety aspect. Cell phones make it easy to contact during emergency even during driving although using cell phone while driving is mostly dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency, listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes etc.

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating while increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers have also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and adjusting accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death.

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic.

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. Based on arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.",0,1
"""When you vote what do you commonly feel? Do you feel as joyful that your making a difference in the country as an elephant in its prime leading the herd?

Or maybe you just don't feel that your vote changed anything, still residing in the vote booth pointlessly waiting to be seen."" The American people have always felt that they alone should decide who is to lead them. While this has been the case since America became a country, there are those who feel our current process of electing the people who will elect your candidate isn't a desirable system.

"In my oponion, I think the state senator should not change the Electoral College by popular vote for the President of the United States. I think it should not change because this process consists of the selection of the electors. This is where they vote for President and Vice President as well as the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The majority of the electoral votes is to elect the president. This also makes things much easier because each candidate running for president for your state has their own group electors where the electors are chosen by the candidates political party. It is also helpful because you actually help choose your states electors when you vote for your candidate you are voting for your candidates electors. At the end it makes it easier on the governor to list all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.",0,1
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" argues why humans should research Venus, despite the difficulties that may follow. The author provides information about Venus and what makes it such a hard planet to explore, but more importantly, why that should not stop researchers and scientists. Through the author's compelling argument, readers are able to form their own opinion of whether Venus should be explored. The author supports the idea of studying Venus well by dicussing benefits, ways to avoid dangers on Venus, and future experiments, all while including strong evidence and interesting hooks to captivate the readers.

After sharing information about Venus, the author begins to discuss the benefits of exploring the planet. The author supports their argument well by giving compelling evidence to back up their statements and opinions. It is stated in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". This quote shows the value in exploring Venus, further supporting the author's argument. The article goes on to share another compelling reason; the fact that Venus is ""our nearest option for a planetary visit"", as stated in paragraph 4. The current limitations of space travel only allow for close visits for astronauts, making Venus a compelling planet. By discussing the benefits of exploring Venus and giving evidence to support it, the author starts off their argument very strong.

Next, the author shares how astronauts can get past the many dangers that Venus presents. This acts as a refutation for any arguments that claim Venus is too dangerous to explore. In paragraph 5, the author shares an idea of a blimp-like vehicle that would allow astronauts to survive. They state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". There are also other approaches that can be taken that the author shares. In paragraph 7, simplified electronics are discussed because of their ability to survive on Venus. This ongoing project shows that there are ways to explore Venus and that the idea is not entirely impossible. The author also brings in evidence to support their claim by sharing the science behind simplified electronics. This shows that the statements made are not false and allows for the readers to understand how the electronics work. These refuations leave no doubt for any other arguments, creating a stronger support.

The author later compels the readers with motivation and inspiration by arguing that the challenges should only bring more drive to explore the impossible. In paragraph 8, they state, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". The author is able to finally bring to rest the argument that Venus is too dangerous to explore. More importantly, it also shows the emotion that the author brings into the paper. All throughout the article, the author uses many hooks in order to draw the reader in. This technique makes the article more approchable and altogether much more interesting. Discussing the value in exploring Venus allows readers to believe that humans are capable of surpassing the challenges, despite the odds. It also draws more interest in, as not all people who read the article will be interested in space or the importance of it. Even if someone who reads the article is not interested, they will at least be inspired at the end. The last sentence in the article states ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Imagination and innovation appeal to everyone, allowing for a stronger arguement that will presuade anyone who reads the article.

Overall, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a very presuasive article. The paper starts off with information about Venus, drawing the reader in. The author explains the reasons why humans should not be daunted by the nature of the planet, and goes on to give evidence to support their reasons. Solutions are given in order to survive Venus' challenges in order to refute any arguments against their claims. Lastly, the author uses strong hooks and compelling arguments that appeal to anyone in order to create a persuasive article that interests the reader from beginning to end. The idea that Venus should be explored is well supported in the article, leaving no one to be against it.",0,1
"Having more options to choose from is better than having one option.

One reason that multiple options are better than one is because you could get advice from people that have done something similar to what you are doing. This way, you could do something more easier or better because you got advice from them. Also, if they did something similar to you, you could learn from what they did to accomplish their task and take some steps they took to finish their objective and do something similar. Lastly, you would learn from the people that gave you advice since they have been through something the same or something similar.

Another reason that having more options are better is because you would have more options to choose from. This way, you would test the advice the people gave you and see what results you got. Also, having more options to choose from than only having one would be better because you would have more information with the wide variety of options than only one option which probably won't give you a lot of information. Lastly, having more options to choose from is better than just having only one option.

One last reason why having more options are better is because you could narrow down options that you don't like until you come across one you like. This way, you won't have to do something you don't like in fear of messing up, or failing your task. Also, you could take the options you have, and you test them to see if they come up with the results that you like instead of getting results that you hate. Lastly, you could root out options that people gave you that you think won't work, or don't like.",0,1
"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to to that.

For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run.

For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didn't give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did.

In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

"I think that the electoral college should stay, because the electoral college is a process that with help our country and future problems. most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.",0,1
"Phones & Cars: The Dream (Nightmare) Team

Considering that these essays are graded by staff workers who aren't paid enough, I'd think it's fair to say that the reader of this is a driver. Whether you go buy car, bike, bus, etc. it's still driving, and driving should never be combined with texting or phone calling. Using the phone while driving is never safe, neither to yourself nor others.

One key point is that you become distracted. Becoming distracted can cause danger to yourself or others, as you are piloting a giant steel box. Going offroad could hurt yourself. You could also accidentally smash into other cars.

You could also use your phone's bluetooth to stream music to your car's radio. However, since you're only listening to music that you already like, there's a good chance that you might get too into the music and get distracted. This could also cause you to run off the road and potentially hurt yourself and others.

In conclusion, phones can be a dangerous and evil device that can cause harm to you or other drivers while you are on the road. Because of this, you should always put away your phone once you begin driving. Throw it into the back seat or put it in the glove box.",0,1
"It can wait

As a young teen in America, I understand that using your phone while driving is very common nowadays. Although it is common, it's probably not the best decision to make. As technology improves, cell phone usage will continue to increase, especially in millennials. This does not mean that all cell phone usage is bad, but it does mean that everyone should reconsider using cell phones while driving. On a daily basis, I hear about people my age dying due to car accidents, because they chose to be on their cell phones while driving. Using your phone while driving can cause distractions, accidents, or put passengers and other drivers in danger.

While studying for my driver's test, I was overwhelmed by the seriousness of the laws about phone usage and driving. Phone usage while driving is against the law for several reasons. One reason why cell phone usage is against the law is because of the distractions that it can cause. We commonly see people using cellphones while driving every day, but it is illegal, Found on GHSA.org . Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions such as texting, or using social media. I strongly feel individuals should solely focus on driving when their car is in motion. When I started driving, I understood the importance of waiting to respond to any notifications that I receive, and putting my phone on do not disturb. I think that everyone should consider using this feature on their cell phones because it can potentially save their life or someone else's.

Furthermore, I think that driving while using your phone is not only dangerous, but it's also could be the reason for half of America's fatalities. It only takes seconds for someone to look down at their phone and cause a wreck. Cell phone usage itself is expanding, but I think that if people aren't considerate of their lives they should be considerate of others. For example, phone usage while driving could include snap chatting, taking selfies, searching for a song, or as simple as using your phone for directions. Phenomenally, phone usage has turned into a habit.

I've seen people use their phones while driving and it makes me question if they even care about their own lives. I think that risking someone else's life to check social media, respond to a message, or simply changing a song is ignorant. In today's society, phone usage has become a serious problem and I want to stress to millennials and my fellow peers, it can wait. Seeing people using their phones while driving not only bothers me, but it concerns me about the well being of my family. Phone usage while driving can cause car accidents, which can lead to a lifelong lesson. Whether the car accident results in a bad injury or death, it can change your life, forever.

Subsequently, as a teenager, I commonly see my friends posting videos while driving down the road with my other friends. Cell phone usage and driving are very illegal but most get away with it because they do it discreetly. I think that in today's time, everyone struggles with the concept of not ""texting and driving"". As mentioned before , my peers texting or making snapchat videos while driving, could cost them their lives. Mentioned on Healinglaw. com, there are stories teeneagers getting into wrecks because of the distractions of phone usage and their passengers distracting them. This careless act resulted in a bad wreck, which caused serious injuries. I often think to myself, ""why would one want to put someone else's life at risk, over a text?"" Something that I realized was that I cannot control my friend's actions, but I can control my own. I love my life enough to not risk it over a text message.

In conclusion, I think that even though phone usage while driving can be very tempting, it is not necessary. I think that phone usage while driving should continue to be illegal, I do not agree with putting someone's life at risk over a simple text or video. Putting your own life in danger or someone else's life in danger is a careless act that must be shunned upon. I also don't agree with the simple distractions that come along with phone usage and driving. Once one is behind the wheel, their phone should be on the do not disturb mode, and they should put their phones face down until they reach their destination. If a person has to use their GPS system while driving, it should be properly mounted in their car in concordance with all of the existing cell phone usage while driving laws. With that being said, I understand the concept of using a GPS while driving. However, I disagree with the concept of cell phone usage to text others and the use of social media platforms while driving. It can wait.

"What is your favorite thing to do during your free time? Do you stay in bed and watch movies? Do you go to your community library to read books and study? Or do you just go outside for a walk?

Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside.

Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isn't a really competitive game and can be played alone, it's better when its played with other people.

Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isn't usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids.

Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park.",0,1
"The surface of Mars is a great mystery to human kind, but the Face on Mars is just a coincidental human face resembling landform. The Face may resemble a human face, but there are also many other things that humans think are faces. One of these landforms that may look like a face is the face on the moon and even clouds can resemble faces. Therefore I believe that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform.

Although it may appear as a face to many people created by aliens, there has been no scientific proof that aliens exist. It's obvious that the Face on Mars is a peninsula or hill landform that may happen to look like a human face. If there was a peninsula or hill landform on Earth that happened to appear as a face, would everyone jump to the assumption of aliens? Then again there is no scientific evidence that aliens don't exist, but aliens are just made up science fiction creatures that people have come to believe are real.

Therefore the Face on Mars is just a peninsula or hill landform that coincidentally happens to appear as a human face. Just because it happens to look like a humans face and its in outer space people jump to the assumption that aliens are the reason behind the Face on Mars. The entire idea of aliens is just a joke humans made up to scare other humans. In conclusion, that is why I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform that happens to resemble a human face.",0,1
"Decreased Driving

In the past, the act of driving was a mandatory ability to possess, but as time progresses, the use of personal cars is declining. The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.

Pollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don't have a large influence on pollution, but ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 5). Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 34). The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" (Duffer Paragraph 10). As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" (Duffer paragraph 14).

In order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a close-knit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 9).

Not only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'"" (Selsky paragraph 24).

In addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.

In conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car. These benefits range from improving the condition of the environment thorugh reducing pollution, as well as saving money for those not",0,1
"Phones and Driving

Now that everyone has a cell phone, usage while driving is common. People are multitasking ang doing all sorts of work things, like calling, emailing, and texting while driving. I do not believe that cell phones should be used while driving in any capacity. I believe this because safety and focus are extremely important and there are enough distractions without adding any more.

Cars can be very dangerous. It's very important to be safe always. At any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 are attempting to use phones while behind the wheel of a vehicle. Phones have connected us at all times. But that can cause serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving.

Distracted driving is one of the fastest growing safety issues. According to the (NHTSA), 3,477 people were killed and estimated 391,000 people were injured on U.S. roadways in 2015 because of distracted drivers. Distracted driving is doing another activity while driving. This takes driver's attention away from the primary task of driving and increases the risks of crashing. Common distractions are not limited to talking on a cell phone, texting, reading, eating, grooming, using a navigation device, and turning the radio.

The presence of a passengers and animals can also increase crash risk. Georgia law requires drivers to care in driving a vehicle and prohibits any action that distracts the driver from the safe operation of such vehicle. Georgia has a new Hands-Free Law that mandates that drivers are not allowed to hold or support a phone for any reason. A phone can only be used with headphones, a wireless device, phone holder or mounted device. Penalties are fines and points added to your driving record that increase for each conviction.

All drivers regardless of age are prohibited from reading, writing, or sending a text message while driving. This ban applies to any texting while driving. Exceptions are provided for emergency personnel, drivers responding to emergencies, and drivers who are fully parked. A conviction for either violation will result in the accumulation of one point on driving record. Texting while driving is illegal and can result in death.",0,1
"Although the school system has advanced quite far in recent history, there are still plenty of clear problems with the way children receive their education. Many students are constantly stressed out and are not truly learning the material because of it. Additionally, each student may have a different learning style, so it is not helpful to teach them in large groups with the same methods. The recent innovation of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be utilized by schools to vastly improve the way children are educated.

Many issues with the education system could be improved upon, if not completely eradicated, with the use of facial recognition technology within classrooms. As mentioned in paragraph 6 in the article, FACS can be used to recognize when a student is confused. Schools could take advantage of this technology to notify teachers when a student is struggling with material, and help them get back on track. This would allow teachers to adapt their teaching style to best suit each student. Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better.

The potential of this technology is huge, as it could be used to improve every student's life, both inside and outside of school. If schools were to have the ability to help students with any material they don't understand the first time and asist them in coping with or eliminating stress, it would make the experience of going to school much more enjoyable. This would motivate students to do their best to be successful in school, which would drastically improve their life, as well as society in general. If all schools manage to overcome the technical and monetary difficulties of implementing FACS in teaching, it would benefit everybody in many ways.",0,1
"Phones and Driving

Over time we've seen the consequences of phones and driving manifest itself in the form of negative impacts upon the world. Phones have negatively affected our people in ways that we have experienced so much pain through the increase in casualty rate. Although phones have had its positive advantages, phone have also had it's disadvantage. Over time the increase in technological devices has caused many distraction in more ways than science can explain. Moreso we see this change and distraction throughout out cars and times of travel. Because of the way we are so emotionally attached to our phones, we forget the importance of many different situations at hand. However, drivers should not be able to operate their technological devices while in a vehicle.

When the discussion is brought upon among the awareness of phones and driving, people get mad. They get frustrated in a manner that they feel the authority, police, and the people are in fact "" doing too much"". The vision that the people don't see is the value of their lives and the correlation between that idea and cellphones in use while operating a vehicle. Studies and different statistics have shown the causes of death from the use of cell phones while driving. Within this modern society, different policies and ordinances have been put into place to show the importance of abstaining from the use of cellphones in the vehicles. Not only does using your cellphones in the car out your life in danger, but also the people surrounding you.

The authority and the government needs to make this social issue more aware to the public. The use of cellphones in our vehicles should be prohibited. Too much death and pain has been caused by devices like our cell phones. It is imperative that we make the people more aware on this issue. If we don't take this matter seriously, we will continue to see the negative impact confide within our communitie, nation, and world as a whole. There should be no more talking about the issue and whether or not it should be prohibited. The answer is at hand. Drivers should not be on their devices while operating a vehicle.",0,1
"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0,1
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",0,1
"land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",0,1
"Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.

Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.

In contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.

As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",0,1
"Venus, despite its harsh conditions, boasts valuable information that can only be uncovered by exploring it. At least that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" claims. Throughout the article, the author supports and enforces the idea that Venus' exploration involves many challenges, but scarcely explains the benefits of exploring it and consequently why it is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.

The author firsts opens with several facts about Venus to instill a feeling of doubt within the reader. Through this, he leads into the main idea of the article by abruptly asking the question, ""If your sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" After a doubtful introduction, the author provides arguments of the benefits of returning to this hot, dense world. This was a crucial addition to the article that shows his consideration of uninformed readers by first explaining why Venus is so difficult to explore before beginning his first argument of the benefits of exploring Venus.

He promptly answers the question by again giving several facts about the history of Venus. The inherent nature of the first fact ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" stirs the reader's curiosity, prompting the author to ask the next question to lead into his following argument. This paragraph serves to hook the reader's by giving relatively surprising facts about Venus that consequently describes the appeal for scientists to study such a planet.

After hooking the reader, the author should go in-depth about how Venus' similarities with Earth make it a valuable target for further research and exploration, but instead, he abruptly begins his next argument about the challenges of exploring Venus. Although the main idea of this article is the difficulties of exploring Venus, the author only addresses the value of exploring it in paragraphs four and eight. The rest of the paragraphs are dedicated to giving possible solutions to the impending goal of exploring the planet; however, he does not follow up on paragraph four's message that does not wholly explain the benefits of exploring Venus. At most, the author makes an argument that Venus is ripe for exploration because of its past similarities with Earth, but he does not explain why. Moreover, he introduces his next argument in paragraph five by making the dogmatic claim that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" in paragraph four.

He nevertheless makes an arguably untenable argument about the dangers and difficulties of exploring Venus, but fails to support the idea that exploring it has value. In the end, the author did well in portraying the challenges involved when attempting to explore Venus, but he did not fully support his claim in paragraph four about the initial benefits of exploring it.",0,1
"To whom it may concern, I have recently been enlightened on what Electoral College is all about. According to ""What Is the Electoral college?"" Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. As quoted also from ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

First of all, the Electoral College should be kept because no, one region has the ability to elect a president. A certain region can gather all it's people to favorite one of the candidates, but it still won't be enough to reach a biased conclusion in the final election. The candidates also cannot count on one of their favorite states or even regions for them to win because, with only regional or state appeal, it will become unlikely for them to be a successful president.

In addition, having The Electoral College will ensure that the larger states can't overrule the smaller state based on population. It balances the weight of more populated states to smaller populated states. This is good because now, the smaller populated states will feel that they actually have power in the Election process instead of feeling left out due to a larger population. This is also significant because now the candidates won't aim their campaigning only towards the higher populated states. They will go all around the country trying to emphasize their importance in winning the campaign.

In conclusion, the obvious solution here is to keep using the Electoral College process. It not only ensures that one state or region does not have enough votes alone to sway the election, it allows the smaller populated states to have just as big of a say in the election as the larger states. The procedure of using The Electoral college has been around for quite a while now and it's clear why. It is the most beneficial way of ensuring that the right candidate will get into office, based off of the right terms.",0,1
"Dear Senator,

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.",0,1
"Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.",0,1
"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United Statesit can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nationscountries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middleclass to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for 40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no carsyou'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you.",0,1
"When was the last time you drove a car? Studies have shown that the amount that people have driven over the last couple of years has gone down. There are lots of advantages to limiting car usage. Some of them include: less gas emmisions, emptier and safer streets, and new innovations to compensate for the reduction of car usage. Plenty of cities around the world have attempted limiting car usage.

To start off, if citizens limit their car usage, there would be less gas emissions. But, unfortunately there are still plenty of greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. There are other options to do instead of driving, you could skate, bike, walk, or etc. The gas emissions are a huge problem in today's society and we have to change something about the way we live. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, they have a car-free day once a year.  This reduces the smog that is kept in the air from the gas emissions.

Continuing on, if citizens limit their car usage, we would have safer streets for sure. With less cars driving up and down the street, kids can feel free to play in the street without having to worry about a reckless driver coming down and mowing them all down. Even suburban planners in the US are trying to create ""car reduced"" communities. Instead of using cars, public transportation is becoming the new thing.

Lastly, with people not using cars to get everywhere, some innovations would be made. Side walks would be reconstructed, less rush-hour traffic, new restaraunts and shopping districts within walking distance, and parks and sport centers would blossom. In Bogota, all of those have blossomed since they have started it back in the mid-90s. With the end of car culture also, new innovations have to spring up.

To close out, cars are being used less and less. And they should be because they cause gas emissions, unsafe streets, and bad construction. But, we are slowly moving away from that culture and who knows what into!",0,1
"In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.

Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person. The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.

The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (6). By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education.

The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial

"When I need advice, I don't just ask one person I ask multiple people. When someone asks multiple people they usually make a better choice. People usually make a better choice when they seek multiple opinions because it gives them more ideas for what they should do, and if multiple people say the same opinion, then it usually means it's good advice. These are some reasons why you ask more than one person.

The first reason is because it would give the person more ideas on what they should do. If you can't think of what to do, why not just ask a few of your friends what they would do, then you could get an idea of what you should do. Say that you dropped your phone and it broke, and your mom is going to get very mad at you if she finds out, and you have no idea what to do. You could just call a couple of your friends ask them what they would do, then you would have a whole bunch of ideas to go off of. Since you asked multiple friends, a couple of them might've given the same advice. That is also a reason why it helps someone make a better choice. If you go to a restaurant and everyone is saying that their steak is the best in town, then it has to be good right? So if you ask six of your friends for advice, and four of them say the same thing, then it has to be good advice.

Those are all of the reasons why multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. These are just a couple of the reasons why but not all of them. There are a lot more reasons. So remember, next time when you need advice, don't just ask one person, ask multiple people.",0,1
"Picture a movie. Now, picture a conflict, and then a mad dash to the airport to declare love or patch things up between the protagonist and a prospective soulmate. In the end, the problem is solved, and the two people have found each other despite all odds. The outcome is picturesque, perfection tied up with a bow. However, it wasn't always this way. Something has to happen for the protagonist to finally hop into a taxi and speed off into the sunset. That something almost always takes place after the main character is overwhelmed with something they cannot control, something they find too hard to handle on their own. That something is advice. The value of advice to the protagonist is surely immeasurable, as it shows that someone cares, and provides them with a plethora of separate ways to look at the issue. Advice is vital to a person's grasp of a situation, and the positive effects of good advice are priceless.

We as human beings crave empathy. If it is lacking from a person's life, chances are they will be drawn to any hint of it from somebody else. Advice is a common form of empathy, as it is made up of an understanding of a certain situation and sympathy towards the problems it is causing a person. It displays a level of awareness that isn't found in other contexts. Being able to listen to advice from more than one person helps regardless of what is being said, because it reassures a person that they are not alone in dealing with their problem.

Even though advice is generally recieved from trusted individuals, it is important to be careful. When it comes from someone whose intentions are to help solve the issue, it can have a positive effect on the reciever. If it is doled out by someone whose sole intention is to benefit themselves, it can harm everyone involved. In order to avoid the latter, it is exceedingly important to rely on not just one person's opinion, but a wide variety of solutions to the problem. That way, instead of risking your emotions and livelihood on a single, possibly prejudiced opinion, you can analyze an array of opinions to find the ones that help you the most.

A month ago, I found out I was moving to another county. This meant that I would be away from the high school that I had applied to, and that because of the distance I wouldn't be able to see my friends again. It seemed like there was no successful end in sight, and that I had tried every possible solution with no outcome. I went to see a therapist to talk about this issue, and to seek some reassurance that I would be all right no matter where I went. Listening to one person, however, didn't help me feel any better. In the end, what helped was talking it through with my friends and listening to each and every one of their opinions on the matter. I didn't feel alone, as though I was the only one who cared about how this was affecting me, and I was able to look at the situation with fresh eyes. I was faced with solutions I hadn't even considered, because they were coming from people who could empathize with me in a different way. When it came to how to handle this difficult experience, I could make a choice based on not just my own thoughts, but the thoughts of those around me.",0,1
"Car usage around the world has skyrocketed pollution levels tenfold. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for 2 days to help clear out the fog in the city (Source 2). Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road. Maybe it's just best to limit car usage and pull out the old bicicle or take the bus and meet new people.",0,1
