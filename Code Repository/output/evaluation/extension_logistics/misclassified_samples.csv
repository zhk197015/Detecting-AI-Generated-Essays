"Over the past few decades, talk regarding car pollution and usefulness has become common. Several people believe that the neglegence of cars is beneficial to the world, while others hold the belief that automobiles are a necessary part of daily life. Living in a world without cars can be very beneficial on many levels. Many entities benefit as a result of the use of other forms of transportation. The explanations of the help and drawbacks of a car-free society will be examined in this essay.

Car free land helps the environment to a vast extent. In many countries, automobile emission is the leading cause of air pollution that in return can harm the environment. This form of pollution is especially eminent in densely populated cities where public transport is unavailable. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the global city,"" as found in source 2, demonstrates the already global initiatives being taken by the governments of particular nations. Many pro-car arguments will contend that factories cause more pollution than cars, but they fail to consider how many countries' economies depend on factory goods while car usage can be replaced with alternatives that are better for the prosperity of the planet.

Many new alternatives to cars have been created. From source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation."" Many forms of transportation, be it public or private should be made available to residents of nations. Metros, hybrid power buses, and monorails can be implemented in cities where pollution from smog is a problem, as they pollute in negligible amounts if at all. Private solutions can be viable for people who prefer a more calm approach to saving the world. Hybrid cars are now becoming more widespread and available for almost the same price as regular gas emission vehicles. Hybrids are powered mainly on electricity and batteries, and do not give off harmful carbon monoxide that destroys the ozone layer.

The purchasing rate of cars has already decreased. As demonstrated in source 4, ""If the pattern [ofÂ  the decrease in car purchases] persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Here it is evident that the switch to more ""eco-friendly"" solutions to transportation are naturally and calmly happening. Ergo, the people of many states and countries have already taken the initiative to make the change, but it is also now up to the government to implement public transportation for the portion of the population that cannot afford their own form of travel. This initiative has been taken in cities like Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Moscow.

As truly mentioned in the first source, ""[People] have given up their cars."" This is the first step to a world that is pleasant to the environment all around the world, as the health of plants, animals, and even humans is dependent on the air around them. Not only is public transport becoming more and more evident in select cities, but personal electric vehicles are opportune as well. This is a new age and people should take advantage of it. Smartphones, laptops, and other technological feats are neat, but in order to be able to enjoy those luxuries, we need to be able to appreciate our Earth and treat it with respect by becoming a car-free world.",0,1
"Hey, I know that some people believe that the Face on Mars is proof that aliens visited our planet, but let's get real here. There's no way that some aliens carved a giant face into the side of a mountain on Mars. I mean, think about it. If they had the technology to travel all the way to Mars and build a face, don't you think they would have left behind more evidence than just a weird mountain?

Plus, the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" explains that the Face is just a natural landform that was created by geological processes. The author, a scientist named Alfred McEwen, says that the Face is actually a mesa, which is like a flat-topped mountain, and that it was formed by erosion and weathering over millions of years. He even has pictures that show how the Face has changed over time, which proves that it's been there for a long time and wasn't just suddenly built by aliens.

I know some people might say that the Face looks too perfect to be natural, but that's just not true. McEwen explains that the Face is actually a pretty common landform in the Martian terrain, and that it's not unusual for mesas to have flat, smooth surfaces. He even compares it to other mesas on Mars that have similar features.

Also, the article talks about how the Face was discovered in 1976 by a NASA spacecraft, and how scientists have been studying it ever since. If aliens had built the Face, don't you think they would have said something about it by now? It's been almost 50 years since it was discovered, and there's still no sign of any alien life on Mars.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not some supernatural alien creation. It's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes over millions of years. There's no evidence to support the idea that aliens built it, and plenty of evidence to support the idea that it's just a regular old mesa. Let's be real, people. It's time to stop believing in fairy tales and start trusting the science.",1,0
"In this day and age, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things.Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a carfree lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconceived notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only costeffective, but it also dramatically decreases greenhouse gas emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the nonrenewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very costeffective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs 40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, gas, tolls, and repairs that come with being a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to give up a small amount of convenience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to get to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, humanpowered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accommodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse gases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in leiu of driving and reduces the amount of cars on te road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small inconvience caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized.",0,1
"Nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. There is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. However, I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work.

One reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. They will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. Spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. They will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. Students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. Students

Another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. Students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. Evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. Students will not turn homework or projects on time. Students deserve to have extra time to study.

Final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. Students work to be independent. Students work to pay for their future education. Students work to help their families financial. Students work to achieve their future goals. They work to not have a miserable life in their future. Work will give them more opportunities in their life.

To conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. Students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. Schools should think a little bit more about student's responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life. I know that the education is very important ,but student deserve to make their own decisions. ",0,1
"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",0,1
"Dear Fellow Citzens,

We all know that cars are a big part of our lives. They get us places fast and make our lifes alot easier. But have you ever thought about how cars are effecting the earth? There are alot of bad things that come from cars. They polute the air and make it harder to breathe. They use alot of gas which comes from fossil fuels which are running out. And they kill alot of people. Like, thousands of people die in car accidents every year. It's crazy.

We should limit car usage for a bunch of reasons. First off, it'll help the earth. If we all drove less, there would be less polution in the air. Plus, we wouldnt use as much gas and that means we wouldnt be using up all the fossil fuels so fast. And it would be safer. There would be fewer cars on the road, so there would be fewer accidents. It's a win-win.

Also, it would be good for our health. Walking and biking are great ways to exersise. If we did those things more, we would be alot healthier. And it would be good for the econimy too. If we all walked and biked more, we wouldnt have to pay so much for gas and car maintance. Think about it.

There are allready alot of ways we can limit car usage. We can carpool, use public transportation, and bike or walk when it's possible. Some cities even have bike lanes and stuff. We just need to start doing it more.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great way to help the earth and our health. It's good for the econimy too. We should all try to drive less and use other ways to get places.

"Often times, when we're looking for advice we talk to multiple people, why is that? When your looking for advice or a solution to a problem, do you talk to more than one person? If so, did that lead to a better result? In my experience talking to multiple people about a problem proved to be a good idea. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of people's experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.

First off, one reason why you should seek multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice are people's experiences. People's experiences shape who they are, and determine how they respond to certain situations. Different people have different experiences, leading to different responses. Someone who has ran into your situation before will most likely give better advice than someone who's never been in that situation. People tell you to respect your elders because of all the experiences they've had, older people probably have a lot of solutions to problems you may have.

Secondly, another reason why you should talk to multiple people about a situation are perspectives. Every person has an unique perspective, influenced by their past experiences or current situation. For example, if two people went to the store, a three year old and a twenty one year old, their perspectives would be very different. Everybody looks at a situation from a different perspective, and that can prove useful when you're looking for advice. The way someone comprehends a situation can be heavily influenced by their perspective.

Lastly, there are people's backgrounds. Someone's background is made up of many different things including ethnicity, religion, or culture. Across cultures situations can be interpreted and handled differently, so someone's background can impact their interpretations of situations or problems. All this can lead to advice you wouldn't get from your own background. Someone's background plays a role in the first to things I mentioned, experience and perspective. People's unique backgrounds can give them unique experiences and perspectives, that might differ from your own.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to seeking multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice, and there are many things that can have an impact on the advice people may give you. If you didn't ask others for advice, you would only have your own knowledge to deal with your problems, instead of the world of knowledge at your disposal. I believe you should seek opinions from multiple people because of people's unique experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.",0,1
"I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards the electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the persidential election, your governor prepares a ""

Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as a part of the official records of the presidential election.

The Electorial Collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. They avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the casts.",0,1
"If we look at official statistics of the industrialised and developing world, we immediately realize that the number of cars has been constantly increasing over time. In the United States, for example, the average age of a car has increased from 4.5 years in 1950 to 6.3 years today, while in the UK it has risen from 5.4 years to 7.2 years. The average length of time for a new car to be on the road has also increased over the same period, from 3.6 years for the 1950s to 4 years and 6 months for today's cars.

"Dear Senator,

I am writting to you today to share my opinion on the Electoral College. I think that we should keep the Electoral College the way it is. One of the main reasons why is because it makes sure that smaller states have a say in the election. If we didn't have the Electoral College, then the presedent would only have to worry about the big states and the smaller ones would be left out. This would be unfair to the people who live in those states.

Another reason why the Electoral College is good is because it makes the election more fair. If we had a popular vote system, then the person who wins would be the one who gets the most votes overall. But that wouldn't be fair because some states have way more people than others. For example, Californa has a lot more people than Wyoming, so if we had a popular vote system, then the presedent would probibly be from Californa and the people in Wyoming would have no say in the matter.

I also want to address the counterclaim that the Electoral College is outdated. I don't think this is true because it was made for a reason. It was made to make sure that smaller states have a say in the election and to make the election fair. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not still useful.

I also want to point out that the Electoral College has been useful in the past. For example, in the 2000 election, George W. Bush won the presidency because of the Electoral College, even though Al Gore got more popular votes. This shows that the Electoral College can make a difference and it's important to have it.

In conclusion, I think that we should keep the Electoral College the way it is. It's fair, it makes sure that smaller states have a say in the election, and it's been useful in the past. I hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the Electoral College.

"I believe that education is a lifelong process. To begin with, education is not a one time event. It is a continuous process that one must continue throughout their life. The more education one receives, the more opportunities they have for success. This is evident by looking at the people who have gone through the most education. They have achieved the most success in their fields.

One example of this is Bill Gates. Gates is one of the richest people in the world and he has earned this money through his work in the computer industry. Gates has a degree in computer science from Harvard University. This is just one example of how a degree from a prestigious university can help you achieve success.

There are countless other examples of people who have achieved success because of their education. A person who is educated can find a job that matches their skills and interests. They can also find a job that allows them to use their education to help them become successful.

Second, education is not just about learning information. It is also about developing skills and abilities. This is why education is important for people who want to find a job that matches their skills and interests. A person who is educated can find a job that allows them to use their education to help them become successful.

Third, education is a source of pride. It is a way for people to show off their skills and abilities. This is why education is important not only for people who want to find a job, but for people who want to become successful. A degree from a prestigious university can help you achieve success.

All of these reasons make me believe that education is a lifelong process. I believe that education is important for people of all ages. It is a way for people to achieve their goals and to become successful.

"It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns. Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during next two decades. The trend of using cell phones has increased throughout the world. One of the primary reasons for the gigantic growth of cell phones is that they facilitate communication offering high levels of flexibility reaching desired person within seconds whether he/she is at office, home, or outside driving a car etc. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectively and without wastage of any time. Other main reason for the explosive growth of cell phones is the safety aspect. Cell phones make it easy to contact during emergency even during driving although using cell phone while driving is mostly dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency, listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes etc.

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating while increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers have also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and adjusting accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death.

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic.

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. Based on arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.",0,1
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a really cool thing. It can detect emotions on people's faces and it's like a computer can read your mind. The article says it's like a game changer. But, I'm not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom.

First of all, it's kinda creepy. Imagine if a computer is watching you all the time and can tell what you're feeling. It's like Big Brother is always watching you. It's like you can't even have a secret. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks you're feeling sad when you're actually just tired? That could be really embarrassing.

But, on the other hand, it could be useful. If a teacher can see that a student is feeling upset, they can help them. Maybe the student is struggling with a concept and the teacher can explain it in a different way. Or maybe the student is feeling bullied and the teacher can step in and help. It's like having a superpower.

Also, it could be fun. Imagine if you could play games that use the Facial Action Coding System. You could play a game where you have to make different emotional expressions and the computer has to guess what you're feeling. It would be like a reverse version of ""Guess Who"" where the computer is trying to guess who you are.

In conclusion, I think the Facial Action Coding System is a cool technology but it's not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom. It could be useful but it could also be creepy and embarrassing. But, it could also be fun. It's a hard decision and I'm not sure what I would choose. Maybe we could just use it for games and not for real life.",1,0
"Dear State Senator,

I am writting to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I think it's a good idea to keep it the way it is. I know some people think it's unfair but I don't agree.

First of all, the Electoral College makes sure that the President has to win support from a lot of different places. If we just had a popular vote, the President would only have to worry about the biggest states and the people in the smaller states would get ignored. This way, the President has to care about everyone.

Another thing is that the Electoral College helps to keep the country together. If we didn't have it, the President would just be chosen by the most populous states and the other states would feel left out. This way, everyone gets a say.

I know some people say that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it means that the President can win without getting the most votes. But, as the article we read in class said, that's not always true. In fact, it's only happened a few times in history. And when it does happen, it's usually because the election is really close and the Electoral College helps to make sure that the President is chosen fairly.

I also want to say that changing to a popular vote system would be hard to do. It would take a lot of work and it might even cause some problems. For example, the article we read said that some states might try to rig the election by giving their electoral votes to the candidate they like the most, even if the people in that state didn't vote for them.

So, I think it's best to keep the Electoral College the way it is. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And it's been around for a long time, so it must be doing something right.

Thank you for listening to my opinion. I hope you will consider what I said when you're making your decision.

"Do you think its a good idea for computer to be abel to read our emotions? Some peoples might say yes, but i think its a bad idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can read peoples emotions by looking at there face. Its like a computer can see how you feel. But what if you don't want it to know how you feel? What if you don't want people to no your secrets?

Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Car-free communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to car-free lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient (Rosenthal, Selsky). Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's city-wide car-free day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 (Selsky). A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" (Rosenthal).

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for ... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal). Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear (Duffer). Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more eco-conscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency (Duffer).

Car-free communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though; car-free communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them (Rosenthal, Selsky). Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in city-typical, and definitely Miami-typical, traffic jams (Duffer).

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of car-free lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards car-free communities (Rosenthal). Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or car-pool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues (Rosenthal). Scientists, sociologists, and citizens alike will most likely agree that this move will indubitably be one for the better!",0,1
"I think that the electoral college should stay, because the electoral college is a process that with help our country and future problems. most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.",0,1
"Do you agree or disagree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today? My answer is that I do not believe that there will be many more cars in use in the future. The reason for this is that the number of cars that are used in the U. S. Is declining at an alarming rate. The number of cars in use in the U. S. Was 254,000 in 2009, but it is projected that this number will be lower than 50,000 by 2019. This decline is primarily due to the fact that the number of people in the U. S. Is increasing, and the number of cars that are used to transport these people is not increasing as quickly as the number of cars that are used to transport people.

The reason that the number of cars in use in the U. S. Is declining is also due to the fact that the number of people that are driving cars is increasing. The number of people that are driving cars has increased by 50 percent since the early 2000s. This increase in the number of people that are driving cars is because of the fact that the number of people that are working in the U. S. Has increased as well. The number of people that are working in the U. S. Is increasing because the number of people that are working in jobs that require a car.

"When people want to make a good choise, they ushally ask for advice. But somethimes they talk to more than one person. This is a good idear because it can help them make a better choise.

First of all, when you talk to only one person, you only get one point of view. That means you don't get to hear other peoples thoughts and ideas. For example, if you want to know if you should get a dog, and you only ask your mom, she might say yes. But if you also ask your dad, he might say no. Then you have to think about both sides and make a decition.

Another reason why seeking mulitple opinions is good is that it can help you find the best solushun. When you talk to different people, they might have different ideas on how to solve a problem. For example, if you want to know how to do better in school, you might ask your teacher, your friend, and your tutor. Your teacher might say do your homework every nite, your friend might say don't worry about it, and your tutor might say practice your math problems. Then you can take all those idears and come up with a plan that works best for you.

Lastly, talking to more than one person can help you not get stuck on one idear. Sometimes when we like something, we can get stuck on it and not think about other options. By talking to different people, you can hear about other options and not get stuck on one thing. For example, if you want to be a baseball player, you might only think about playing in the major leagues. But if you talk to your coach, they might tell you about other leagues you can play in.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is a good idear when you want to make a good choise. It can help you get different point of views, find the best solushun, and not get stuck on one idear. So next time you need advice, don't be afeard to ask more than one person!",1,0
"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers think that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. For example, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance on E-dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Write an essay of roughly 300 words.

The overuse of electronic dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. The first disadvantage is that it might lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. When we look up every word we don't know how to spell in the dictionary, we will never learn how to spell them correctly. For example, if we always look up the word ""embarrassment"" in the dictionary, we will never remember how to spell it correctly. The second disadvantage is that it might make us lazy. If we always look up words in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the words from the context. For example, if we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the word from the context. The third disadvantage is that it might make us rely on dictionaries too much. If we always look up words in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the words from the context. For example, if we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the word from the context.

There are also some advantages of using electronic dictionaries. The first advantage is that it can help us learn new words. If we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will learn the meaning of the word. The second advantage is that it can help us check the spelling of the words. If we are not sure about the spelling of a word, we can look it up in the dictionary. The third advantage is that it can help us find the meaning of the words quickly. If we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we can find the meaning of the word quickly.

Overall, I think the disadvantages of using electronic dictionaries outweigh the advantages.

"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0,1
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",0,1

"Introduction:
Studying Venus seems like a dangerous idea, but is it worth it? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that it is. They say that even though it's hard and dangerous, we can learn important things from Venus that will help us understand Earth and even other planets. But does the author do a good job of showing that it's worth it? In this essay, I'll say why I think they do.

Body:
The author tells us that Venus is like Earth in a lot of ways. It's similar in size and weight, and it's got a thick atmosphere too. But that's where the similarities end. Venus is way hotter than Earth, and the air is full of dangerous gases. The author says that studying Venus can help us learn about Earth's climate and how it could change in the future. They also say that Venus is a good place to test technology for future missions to other planets. This means that what we learn on Venus might help us on other planets too.

The author also tells us that some missions to Venus have already been successful. They mention the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped Venus' surface in the early 1990s. This mission helped us learn more about Venus' geology and gave us some really cool pictures. But even though there have been successes, the author also tells us about the dangers of exploring Venus. They say that the atmosphere is so thick and hot that it destroys most spacecraft that try to land. This means that we have to be really careful and smart if we want to send people to Venus.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author does a good job of showing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They give us good reasons for why it's important to explore Venus, like learning about Earth's climate and testing technology for other planets. They also show us that it's not impossible to explore Venus, even though it's hard. I think that the author makes a strong argument, and I agree that studying Venus is worth it.",1,0
"Is it a good idea to let teachers use technology to describe students emotional expressions? To me I say that it is wrong to examine kids emotional expressions because teacher should worry about their ow feelings. They shouldn't be worrying about other students.

Technolgy can be wrong in many ways but this type of technolgy invades students personal space. They feel emotional in lots of different ways because of different reason. The technolgy we use to describe student emotional expressions is smart, but it is wrong to do.

We should not use technology to describe emotional expressions. There is aonther way to describe someones emotional expression by mimicking their facial expressions. All you need to do is try to to make your face look just exactly like your friend then tell what he might be feeling. There are many ways to describe someones emotional expression just by not using technology.

"Phones & Driving

People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.

Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.

Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.

Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.",0,1
"Venus, despite its harsh conditions, boasts valuable information that can only be uncovered by exploring it. At least that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" claims. Throughout the article, the author supports and enforces the idea that Venus' exploration involves many challenges, but scarcely explains the benefits of exploring it and consequently why it is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.

The author firsts opens with several facts about Venus to instill a feeling of doubt within the reader. Through this, he leads into the main idea of the article by abruptly asking the question, ""If your sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" After a doubtful introduction, the author provides arguments of the benefits of returning to this hot, dense world. This was a crucial addition to the article that shows his consideration of uninformed readers by first explaining why Venus is so difficult to explore before beginning his first argument of the benefits of exploring Venus.

He promptly answers the question by again giving several facts about the history of Venus. The inherent nature of the first factÂ ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system""Â stirs the reader's curiosity, prompting the author to ask the next question to lead into his following argument. This paragraph serves to hook the reader's by giving relatively surprising facts about Venus that consequently describes the appeal for scientists to study such a planet.

After hooking the reader, the author should go in-depth about how Venus' similarities with Earth make it a valuable target for further research and exploration, but instead, he abruptly begins his next argument about the challenges of exploring Venus. Although the main idea of this article is the difficulties of exploring Venus, the author only addresses the value of exploring it in paragraphs four and eight. The rest of the paragraphs are dedicated to giving possible solutions to the impending goal of exploring the planet; however, he does not follow up on paragraph four's message that does not wholly explain the benefits of exploring Venus. At most, the author makes an argument that Venus is ripe for exploration because of its past similarities with Earth, but he does not explain why. Moreover, he introduces his next argument in paragraph five by making the dogmatic claim that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" in paragraph four.

He nevertheless makes an arguably untenable argument about the dangers and difficulties of exploring Venus, but fails to support the idea that exploring it has value. In the end, the author did well in portraying the challenges involved when attempting to explore Venus, but he did not fully support his claim in paragraph four about the initial benefits of exploring it.",0,1

the author also descripes how the the in human condions such as the lack of oxygen, high pressure, extreme heat and erupting volancoes, powerfull earth wuakes and frequent lighting strikes are the reasons why no manned missions to venus had, are , or will ever take place.

"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in VenusÂs atmosphere. On the planetÂs surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""
