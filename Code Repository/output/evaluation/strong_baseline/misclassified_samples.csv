Many successful individuals have learned to cultivate resilience in the face of multiple failures. From Thomas Edison's over 1,000 failed attempts at inventing a working electric light bulb to J. K. Rowling's rejection from 12 of the 13 publishers she pitched, each of these individuals have demonstrated that with enough grit and determination, any seemingly insurmountable obstacle can be overcome.

This offers a glimpse of some of the successes achieved by people who refused to give up: 

1. Thomas Edison faced 1,000 failed attempts at inventing a working electric light bulb before finally succeeding.

2. After working as a journalist for 20 years, J.K. Rowling faced rejection from the first 12 publishers she pitched the manuscript for her now iconic Harry Potter series.

3. Wrestling with depression and addiction, Grammy Award winner Lady Gaga took seven years to finish her debut album before finally becoming an international superstar.

4. After being rejected by 150 publishers, Bill Gates helped revolutionize the software industry with the founding of Microsoft.

5. After receiving 27 rejections, author John Grisham landed a major book deal with his first legal thriller The Firm.

6. After playing with the same band for over 10 years, rapper Eminem sold over 10 million albums with his first full-length release The Slim Shady LP.

7. After launching an online book store in 1994 and facing near bankruptcy in the process, Jeff Bezos reinvented the way we shop with Amazon.

8. Despite an initial lack of support, the Wright brothers managed to launch the world's first powered airplane in 1903.

These remarkable individuals demonstrate that, with consistency and dedication, anything is possible. They prove that success often comes to those who don't back down in the face of adversity and who understand the value of never giving up on themselves. By understanding that resilience is essential to success, we can find the courage to keep going even when the going gets tough.",1,0
"Over the past few decades, talk regarding car pollution and usefulness has become common. Several people believe that the neglegence of cars is beneficial to the world, while others hold the belief that automobiles are a necessary part of daily life. Living in a world without cars can be very beneficial on many levels. Many entities benefit as a result of the use of other forms of transportation. The explanations of the help and drawbacks of a car-free society will be examined in this essay.

Car free land helps the environment to a vast extent. In many countries, automobile emission is the leading cause of air pollution that in return can harm the environment. This form of pollution is especially eminent in densely populated cities where public transport is unavailable. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the global city,"" as found in source 2, demonstrates the already global initiatives being taken by the governments of particular nations. Many pro-car arguments will contend that factories cause more pollution than cars, but they fail to consider how many countries' economies depend on factory goods while car usage can be replaced with alternatives that are better for the prosperity of the planet.

Many new alternatives to cars have been created. From source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation."" Many forms of transportation, be it public or private should be made available to residents of nations. Metros, hybrid power buses, and monorails can be implemented in cities where pollution from smog is a problem, as they pollute in negligible amounts if at all. Private solutions can be viable for people who prefer a more calm approach to saving the world. Hybrid cars are now becoming more widespread and available for almost the same price as regular gas emission vehicles. Hybrids are powered mainly on electricity and batteries, and do not give off harmful carbon monoxide that destroys the ozone layer.

The purchasing rate of cars has already decreased. As demonstrated in source 4, ""If the pattern [ofÂ  the decrease in car purchases] persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Here it is evident that the switch to more ""eco-friendly"" solutions to transportation are naturally and calmly happening. Ergo, the people of many states and countries have already taken the initiative to make the change, but it is also now up to the government to implement public transportation for the portion of the population that cannot afford their own form of travel. This initiative has been taken in cities like Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Moscow.

As truly mentioned in the first source, ""[People] have given up their cars."" This is the first step to a world that is pleasant to the environment all around the world, as the health of plants, animals, and even humans is dependent on the air around them. Not only is public transport becoming more and more evident in select cities, but personal electric vehicles are opportune as well. This is a new age and people should take advantage of it. Smartphones, laptops, and other technological feats are neat, but in order to be able to enjoy those luxuries, we need to be able to appreciate our Earth and treat it with respect by becoming a car-free world.",0,1
"Humans. One of the many smart species on planet earth. The species that seems to think they can do anything, including going to Venus. Although Venus is highly dangerous with its high temperatures and extreme clouds of carbon dioxide, it is a worthy pursuit that could be a great benefit for the knowledge of anybody living on earth.

The information that could be gathered is rather incredible. Already this world knows a few features Venus holds, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" It is so amazing to think that already we have this idea of a planet. With hard work and dedication it could be valuble, to further investigate our sister planet. Even though the conditions the planet are critical, we know the dangers. There is a benefit to the planet, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author knows what to say, because they know that the conditions are harsh. And great reward the sccientists recieve what they would need from this raging planet.

The value of this planet is not known only because there is not enough strive to make it happen. The ""human curiosity"" is what leads this planet to greatness. Scientist that want this mission, have to be willing to do whatever it takes for knowledge. They have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks."" Those risks will lead to everything that a scientist could hope for. There is no reason to not believe the author when they say the mission will be worth your while. Only because there is something magnificent about that planet so similar to ours. the author so confidently states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" They so beautifully say what is needed. Imagaination and the need to innovate, for future greatness, is so important for the challenges ahead. Although this world still has unknown factors, finding out incredible things about Venus could change science, and could change the world itself.

Venus is our sister planet, one of the closest to us. How has our natural kick for curiosity not taken over? Humans always want to know everything. Making it clear, there is no point in just letting this fantastic adventure wait. Danger is always a component in exploring something new, that is why humans are knowledgable and powerful. So scientist should not hold back, they need to bring all their smarts to this adventure, and really make something great. It could result in the most indulging finds.",0,1
"Enjoyable educational activities are really good source of learning and doing something fun. Saying so, it's a really good idea that we can get the chances or we can do the activities anywhere, anytime we like.

Activities are or can be educational, many activities can help a lot, on something someone missed or failed a subject in school. It helps the brain work a little harder then other basic stuff that aren't educational. School activities are really educational in many ways, anything that helps or can helps study on anything. Studying is a great reason why we can do fun activities with the subject someone wants to relearn, practices, or just for the feels of it.

Participating on an activities, sports is a great why to participate, not only that is good for the heath, but to socializes. Activities is an easy way to make friends and socializes. Participating in activities can allow to share opinions, or give ideas on something. Participating is a good why to show efforts on something someone is working on in a group of people.

Working in groups, makes the activities fun and more enjoyable. Enjoyable is that someone can talk to their partner or teammate. Being in groups of teams or just a group of people in activites, makes the groups work together. (?)

Not only activities are just to learn and educate, but activities can be fun and enjoyable. Activities can be extremely fun if you give it the efforts of playing, or know how to play. Fun activities can turn into fights or arguments. It's all ways good that we, or someone know how to handle it. The good way for that to never happen is that we need to be respectful, and show kindness to our partner so we don't have problems in our group activities.    ",0,1
"Although sports events may help reduce the tension and bias between different countries and keep the peace of the world in some way, it also may cause something beyond your expectation.

For example, if you are a fan of a certain country, you may be more likely to support that country's team in a sport event than you would be if the team was from a different country. This is because you have an emotional attachment to the country you support. If you were to watch a soccer match between the United States and a team from another country and you did not have a strong emotional connection to that team, then you might not be as interested in watching the match as you otherwise would have been. The same is true for any other sport or event. You may find yourself rooting for a particular team or country in an event or sport, even though you don't have strong feelings for that particular country or team.

"There is no doubt that in the next twenty years, fewer cars will be in use. Car production has decreased over the years, and now only a fraction of the cars that were sold in the 1970s and 1980s are still in use today. 

One reason for this decrease in production is the rise in fuel efficiency. Cars have become more fuel efficient, and this has led to a decrease in the demand for cars. Another reason for the decrease in production is the rise in popularity of electric cars. This trend is continuing, and as electric cars become more popular, the demand for cars will decrease as well.

Overall, I believe that the decrease in production of cars is a good thing. This is because it means that more people are using alternative transportation, and it also means that the environment is being saved.

"I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. I have seen many successful people throughout my life and I have learned that they are not afraid to try new things and take risks. They know that if they are not successful at first, they can always try again and again until they are successful.

One of the most successful people I have ever met was Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was the co-founder of Apple and he was responsible for developing the Macintosh computer and the iPod. He was also responsible for creating the iPhone and the iPad. Steve Jobs was a risk taker and he knew that if he did not try new things and take risks, he would not be successful. He knew that if he was not successful at first, he could always try again and again until he was successful.

"The history of the penny is one of America's most storied and beloved topics. The first United States penny was released in 1787, during the time when American coins were still being designed by private citizens. Since that time, many different versions of the penny have been issued and circulated throughout the country for more than two centuries. The original design featured Lady Liberty facing left with a pole on her left arm holding a liberty cap and an olive branch in her right hand, which symbolized peace and prosperity at the time. This version remained unchanged until 1837 when it was replaced with a bust of President Andrew Jackson. After this change, other variations came into existence over several decades such as commemorative issues honoring Abraham Lincoln or Ulysses S Grant to celebrate important events in US history. In 1909 however, something truly special happened: The Lincoln Cent was introduced by Victor D Brenner as part of then-President Theodore Rooseveltâs initiative to modernize U.S coinage designs; this new version featured a portrait of our 16th president along with his name inscribed along its rim â an iconic feature which has endured ever since! As technology advanced further into the 20th century so too did changes made to pennies; from 1959-2008 they produced memorial reverse designs featuring national monuments like Yellowstone National Park or Mount Rushmore before transitioning back to just one single design featuring Lincoln again in 2009 - marking 100 years since his initial introduction on these coins!. Today millions upon millions of expendable cents are minted every year at locations around our nation representing both past & present generations alike - according them all lasting recognition through their physical currency exchange system! Even though their face value is small compared to some other denominations out there, you could say that each individual penny carries much more weight within our collective conscience due its rich & timeless story â proving just how far even these little pieces can go towards inspiring pride today and well into tomorrow!

"I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help one make a better decision or to handle the situation better. Have you ever had a difficult time deciding on which decision to make? Couldn't decide what gift to buy? How to settle a problem? Usually when a person searches for a gift they ask them selfÂ if the receiver would like it or not, or maybe they ask their friends if they would think the recipient would enjoy it. When a person goes shopping, most people ask which item would be the better deal if they were to buy or if it will of any use to the user. By asking for multiple opinions an individual will be able to receive additional information, different opinions, and obtaining different answers.

An option they can receive after gaining a second opinion, is being able to compare the options that have been received. By being able to analyze second option(s), he or she can compare it to their own and check off the different pros and cons. When sorting out the differences that each option had been criticized, one can check which option would suit the issue better. By doing so, they'd be able to use or add to the original choice, and create a better result for the problem. This method can help most handle the situation for a more positive result and can benefit the person(s) who tries this.

Secondly, the person can receive different information on the topic. By receiving new additional advice or information, they can save it when they need it later on for future situations, or if they are giving advice to someone else. When receiving more information on the situation at hand, you can come to have a better understanding or to be privy to something that you did not know. Usually after learning something new your opinion or thoughts might change. So if you are able to obtain new information from multiple opinions, then your thought on the matter might change based on what you believe or now understand.

Going with the idea of receiving new information, an individual can come to have a better understanding of the situation and obtaining new answers. Like the saying ""You cannot preach what you do not understand,"" you cannot handle a problem that you don't fully understand. By having a stronger understanding of the situation, they'llÂ able to confidently explain why it was chosen as the response. By receiving new answers to the problem, among them a person will eventually find an agreeable answer or When receiving new answers, the variety of answers may vary delivering many new options to mind.

In conclusion,

I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help one make a better decision or to handle theÂ situationÂ better.Â The multiple opinions received can help you obtain different answers, information, and being able to compare the options given. Receiving multiple views and opinions can make the response stronger, confident, and lead to a beneficial outcome. So next time you struggle to decide an option, try seeking a second opinion.",0,1
"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. ",0,1
"To:Barack Obama

Hello dear president, my name is Nathan and I think it's already time to admit that the Electoral college system should always be part of our government.

The electoral college process was established by the founding fathers in order to settle an important compromise in our nation. This electoral process consists of regulating the way in which our nation will decide who will be the next president. Consisting of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This system allows the most experienced people to choose the future of the nation, and changing it to anything else would slowly cause the whole federal system to collapse. The electoral college method may not seem democratic in a modern sense, because it's actually very unique. This method turn off potential voters for a reason; The candidate that must be chosen is the most prepared one. There is so many factors related to the immense amout of security the college electoral process brings to our people that changing this precise system would be like deciding to turn off the country. Choosing an unprepared president will potentially cause the economy to break, civil wars involving every state, protests, and our nation's reputation to die. It was also revealed this year that in the states in which education is one of the main investments, nearly 90% of the people were in favor of the keeping the system the way it is. The electoral college method is professionalism at it's highest level, and any other different system is clearly inferior to it.

It's politically notable how the nation is reacting to this possible change with disappointment and sadness. I hope you as the leader of the people we all love, will understand the amount of value put in this constitution, and notice that changing it would be catastrophic.

"Although the world of music is quite varied and diverse, few genres can capture the same emotion as classical music. From its origins in Europe during the Baroque period to its modern-day interpretation, classical music has stood for centuries as a pillar of artistry and expression. The earliest known forms of classical music emerged during the late 1600s in Italy. This Baroque style was characterized by an intense drama that came from using both major and minor keys, along with complex rhythms and harmonies that imbued a sense of grandeur into every piece. As it made its way through Europe, composers such as Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Scarlatti further developed this style before passing it on to other countries like France or Germany - where it became even more intricate than before. Classical music also played an important role in inspiring later styles like romanticism or modernism; some pieces were even used in operas or ballets throughout history! For example Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata created strong emotions among audiences when premiered back in 1801 due to its melancholic yet powerful melodies â setting a new standard for what would become a classic masterpiece we all know today. . But perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects about classical music is how timeless it remains after hundreds of years: no matter if you're listening to Mozart's The Magic Flute or John Williams' Star Wars score â there will always be something familiar about these sounds that speak directly to our hearts without needing words. Perhaps this is why so many people continue finding comfort within this genre despite changes in culture or technology over time; because at its core Classical Music still captivates us with profound beauty just like it did centuries ago!

"The limitation of human contact has been a negative effect in peoples lives; people are so caught up in today's technology that no one really talks in person anymore. People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect.

Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isn't a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think they're another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person they're tricking to send them money if they live in another country. It's rare that people find someone who doesn't lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they won't find anyone who will really like them.

Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they don't see the person's face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text.

Most people feel like technology has a good effects when it mostly doesn't.

"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger to pinpoint the difference between this and Earth, making heat and physical-resistant machines, and to find possible environment activity.

Earth and Venus may be twins, but that doesn't mean it share the same geographics. In paragraph 3, it says "" The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Therefore, Venus is way hotter than Earth. While talking about Venus' geographic background, it also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. This shows Venus carries more extreme pressure; Consequently, lots of powerful weather.

In this time, most companies make technology that can hold a certain measure of heat and physical conditions. This may also be a challenge to see how much the projects were built to reach its peak or observe downfalls to if it plays a significant role in human activites.. Back in the day technology was powerful to run very quickly, but doesn't have the ability to hold much temperature. In paragraph 2 its says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Also paragraph 7, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons."" This could a starting point of why the making of better phones, computers, and powerful machines exist as generations go by.

To find human activites around Venus is not easy. Due to strong heat it covers, a human or certain machines can't survive not even under a minute. For example, paragraph 3 says "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Venus is almost impossible to squeeze through; Consequently, there could be no chance.

"Venus is one, if not the most interesting planet in our solar system. Next to Mars, and the moon, we have put all of our scientific power into studying this very strange yet interesting planet. At one point in time along the scale of our vastly universe, Venus had the closest living conditions to our home, Earth. The planet has mountains, valleys, and space material impacts. Venus is so fascinating and important to us that we, as a race, are willing to put our lives in danger to explore the unknown planet.

In the passage it says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The meaning behind this sentence showcases that we should not be afraid or unwilling to explore the unknown just because we are scared of what we do not know that is out there. We can not stay on Earth forever. The planet is going to die eventually. We also have concerns of natural resources, over-population, and food density. Which indefinitly means that we need to find a new suitable planet for us, as a race, to strive and survive.

If we do not adapt and overcome our stay on Earth we are smuthering and destroying all the hard work, as a race, that we have put to this planet. Just like in nature, animials are forced to moved from their natural habitats and have to adapt to just simply survive. If we can not do the same we will end up with a much more impactful, dangerous situation. That's what we, as a race, strive on is knowing the unknown.

"For many, the traditional Thanksgiving dinner is a beloved holiday tradition. Every year, families and friends gather around tables piled high with delicious dishes to celebrate their gratitude for all that life has granted them. But how did this ritual come to be? The history of Thanksgiving is as rich and varied as the meal itself. The first recorded observance of what we now know as the modern Thanksgiving dates back to 1621, when members of Plymouth Colony held a three-day celebration in honor of their harvest bounty in what is now Massachusetts. Although no one knows exactly why they celebrated or what foods were served at this gathering (it may not have even included turkey!), it marks the start of an annual event. In subsequent years, other colonies held similar celebrations and by 1789 President George Washington declared a day of national thanksgiving â though it was left up to individual states when or if they should observe such days until 1863, when president Abraham Lincoln proclaimed it should be observed nationally on the fourth Thursday in November each year. Todayâs feast typically features roast turkey accompanied by stuffing and mashed potatoes, plus cranberry sauce, squash casserole and pumpkin pie for dessert - but these dishes didn't make their way onto holiday menus until much later â most likely due to availability rather than tradition! Of course there are regional variations: Southern folks might add fried okra or ham; Northerners might go for seafood chowders; Midwesterners can't resist macaroni & cheese; while Texans opt for savory tamalesâ¦the possibilities are endless! Regardless of who makes what dish or where you call home â both literally and spiritually -- one thing holds true across different cultures: At its core, Thanksgiving reminds us all to pause every so often and appreciate our blessings -- especially over good food shared with those you love!

Throughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome. He said, âThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.â This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. 

One example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. 

On a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.

In the end, itâs important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. As Michelangelo said, âThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.â Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise.",1,0
"I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. It's really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving. I know some people might say that it's important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving, but it's just not worth the risk.

First of all, using a cell phone while driving takes away from the driver's attention on the road. When you're driving, your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel. But when you're on your phone, you're not paying attention to what's happening around you. You might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street. It's just too dangerous.

Another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction. When you're texting or scrolling through social media, you're not focused on driving. You might be looking at your phone instead of the road, and that's when accidents happen. It's like driving blindfolded.

Also, think about how fast you're going when you're driving. You could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster. That means that if you're distracted by your phone, you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it. You could be missing red lights, stop signs, and other important signs on the road.

Furthermore, a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving. They know how dangerous it is, and they don't want people to die or get hurt. If it's illegal, it must be bad.

I know some people might say that they need to be able to use their phone for work or emergencies. But there are ways around that. You could use a hands-free device or have a passenger answer the phone for you. Or you could just pull over to a safe place and then answer the phone. It's not that hard.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed. It's a major distraction and takes away from the driver's attention on the road. It's also illegal in a lot of places, and there are ways to avoid having to use your phone while driving. Drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone.",1,0
"Cellphones & Driving

In our age, many civilians all over the globe use their cellular devices either for activity planning, work related tasks, streaming or just talk or text. Phones in this generation are considered an addiction or a drug to our lives and is in a way that is dangerous due to how easily it is to get distracted, or lose focus, on to them even in times when we shouldn't be on them. When conducting a vehicle, all senses and attention is needed to be on the road to prevent an accident that can come at you from anywhere, when you least expect it. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? When your not focusing on the road, something that requires full attention at all times, it causes distractions and in most cenarios you or others could end up getting hurt or worse.

Driving is an action and responsibility that requires utmost attention when conducting, most especially around family or friends. Distractions can and will get in the way when driving and not acknowledging it is the best and safest course of action a responsible citizen can take. Trying to conduct a vehicle can be difficult for some and easier for others and it's understandable but those who have no knowledge on how to drive still can cause car accidents caused by lack of focus when driving which is why most federal laws were created to prevent phone usage while conducting any motor vehicle and have been since enforced by police officers to keep others and ourselves safe from any possibly dangerous car accidents and fatalities.

Cellular devices were manufactured for fast, reliable, and strong communication to help us react fast if there were to be trouble or we were put in Harm way. Many situations may call us to get help as quickly as possible and there for cellular devices are there to call emergency services . Over the past few years, cell phones have evolved to be able to help us in our daily lives. A good example would be reminders for occasions, calls from or to work/ video chat calls for face to face meetings if necessary, quick information gathering, and many more uses. The mobile era is riding strong and doesn't look like its gonna fall for awhile with many apps developed that can be downloaded and used on our phones from social media apps to learning ones. The use of phones has changed the lives of many to the best or worst occasions, meaning that phones are good for us only at certain times, not all the time.

In all reality is that phones are useful but can cause harm to us and others like health problems, mental problems, and tear what we call fun. Driving is a necessity for moving around different areas quickly if your not in the mood for taking public transportation to get to your certain location. Both the cellular devices and motor vehicles were made to make our lives more convenient and simpler in this new era of hybrid technology, but by irresponsibly combining both together can cause dangerous issues and can and will hurt yourself and the lives of others. Thinking about the ages without these tools life was a much more complex for even the most simplest things and it became harder to keep up with, meaning that staying updated on friends and family or trying to get from place to place was an everyday hassel.

In Overall, the citizens of the states know what's right from wrong and when doing or acting on a certain thing they should know when to do something at the correct time. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? In every single aspex blame will fall onto those who don't and know better not abuse the technology at hand of the new generation like bluetooth devices, speakerphones in the car, and smartwatches for instant access. The federal laws that help and try to prevent people from harm do their most and absolute best to stop dangerous people. The citizens need to contribute to helping each other as well as the law. Driving and texting is a combination that should never ever be done to in order to prevent future accidents and save lives, while being safe from one to another in this free world we call home.",0,1
"The claim of the question is that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This statement is not true. In fact, the number of cars on the road today is higher than it has ever been in the history of mankind. There are more cars than ever before in history.

What is the difference between a car and a bus? A car is a motor vehicle. A bus is an air-conditioned vehicle that is used to transport people.

"The Impact of the Subaru WRX on Automotive Culture Since its introduction in 1992, the Subaru WRX has become an iconic vehicle and a symbol of automotive culture. It is renowned for being one of the best-handling cars ever made, as well as turning heads with its distinctive style. As such, it has had a significant impact on car enthusiasts around the world. For starters, the performance offered by this car has been admired and envied since day one. The original WRX was powered by a 2 liter turbocharged engine that could put out 227 horsepower - more than double what most cars produced at the time. This gave it nearly supercar levels of performance combined with practicality - something few other cars could offer during that period. As such, it quickly gained fame among car fans for its value and capability behind the wheel. Additionally, its all-wheel drive feature further enhanced cornering ability and provided unparalleled traction in any driving condition imaginable - from wet roads to snow or dirt tracks off roading. In terms of styling, there's no mistaking a Subaru WRX when you see one out on public roads today: it features flared fenders along with aggressive bumper designs distinguishable from anything else on four wheels (the STI version even more so). Its boxy shape looks muscular yet still retains an air of finesse unlike many modern sports coupes seen today; while numerous aftermarket parts are also available allowing owners to customize their vehicle to stand out even more amongst other vehicles like them!. . Finally, since its inception over 25 years ago now, countless tuners have sought to modify their own versions of this classic Japanese sports sedan â creating some truly remarkable builds ranging from showroom stock restorations right up to 1000+ horsepower drag racers running 9 second quarter mile times! In this way too then we can see just how much influence this model has had across generations in regards automotive culture worldwide â whether they be serious race

"Hey, I know that some people believe that the Face on Mars is proof that aliens visited our planet, but let's get real here. There's no way that some aliens carved a giant face into the side of a mountain on Mars. I mean, think about it. If they had the technology to travel all the way to Mars and build a face, don't you think they would have left behind more evidence than just a weird mountain?

Plus, the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" explains that the Face is just a natural landform that was created by geological processes. The author, a scientist named Alfred McEwen, says that the Face is actually a mesa, which is like a flat-topped mountain, and that it was formed by erosion and weathering over millions of years. He even has pictures that show how the Face has changed over time, which proves that it's been there for a long time and wasn't just suddenly built by aliens.

I know some people might say that the Face looks too perfect to be natural, but that's just not true. McEwen explains that the Face is actually a pretty common landform in the Martian terrain, and that it's not unusual for mesas to have flat, smooth surfaces. He even compares it to other mesas on Mars that have similar features.

Also, the article talks about how the Face was discovered in 1976 by a NASA spacecraft, and how scientists have been studying it ever since. If aliens had built the Face, don't you think they would have said something about it by now? It's been almost 50 years since it was discovered, and there's still no sign of any alien life on Mars.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not some supernatural alien creation. It's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes over millions of years. There's no evidence to support the idea that aliens built it, and plenty of evidence to support the idea that it's just a regular old mesa. Let's be real, people. It's time to stop believing in fairy tales and start trusting the science.",1,0
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I say that when operating a vehicle that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Some of the reasons are that people use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or even going on the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Truth be told people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. We all have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and safety of others because of our phones.

What people should know is that other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Retarded driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of again the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. For example a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. A person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. A more reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In more studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

In the United States car crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause to distracted driving is cell phones. When drivers talk on the cell phone the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. Drivers using cell phone are not able to give their complete attention.

Lets just think about it everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Moreover, they use argument that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Some businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. What they do not know is that because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident.",0,1
"The neighboring planet to earth, known as Venus has been considered a land of danger. This however, does not stop astronaunts from searching for the unknown answers behind this magnificent planet. Venus represents itself hotter in tempature than Mercury (the closest planet), and is known not to be hospitible to any outside objects. This essay will be explaining few of the reasons why Venus is in fact an intresting discovery in the universe, and depict why it is yet so dangerous.

The first reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit towards the information it consist about, is because if NASA were able to test rocks and other materials, then it would impact the history of science. Science is an amazing attribute to society and if NASA could develop the technology to be able to enter the Venus atmostphere then all the lost questions will be answered. It is also, very similar to Earth.

If the danger of Venus could be determined to an exact pin point then we could use the results to fix and calculate other situations. Each time Earth as send a space aircraft to Venus, it had only lasted moment before it melted. If the substance could be tested then it would influence the world in a scientific way.

In conclusion, despite the critical mess of Venus, many people find it special and unique. The more scientist that get involved with making new technology to show Venus' value, can also help bring the world closer. This is true, because the more that are influenced are the more that will make a difference to society. If NASA exposes continually how similar Venus is to Earth then the way we look at things scientifically will conjure our thoughts",0,1
"In this day and age, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things.Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a carfree lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconceived notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only costeffective, but it also dramatically decreases greenhouse gas emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the nonrenewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very costeffective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs 40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, gas, tolls, and repairs that come with being a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to give up a small amount of convenience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to get to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, humanpowered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accommodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse gases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in leiu of driving and reduces the amount of cars on te road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small inconvience caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized.",0,1
"Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. While some argue that this Facial Action Coding System is a step too far into an innovative future, the advanced program could benefit a multitude of areas.

Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships.

Although the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human's would. Dr. Huang also explains that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.

Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.",0,1
"I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. I think that by understanding concepts, students are better able to think critically and critically analyze information. I also think that by understanding ideas, students are better able to develop their own ideas and theories.

For example, letâs say you are a student. You are reading a book and you are trying to understand the ideas behind the story. You might be looking at the characters and trying to understand their motivations, or you might be looking at the plot and trying to understand the events that happen in the story.

If you are a student, you would be better off understanding the concepts behind the story. Concepts like motivation, events, and plot would help you to think more critically and analyze the information in the book. If you donât understand the concepts behind the story, you might not be able to understand the events that happen in it, or you might not be able to understand the plot.

In the same way, if you are a teacher, you might be better off teaching students how to understand concepts. Concepts like motivation, events, and plot would help you to think more critically and analyze the information in the class. If you donât understand the concepts, you might not be able to understand the information in the class, or you might not be able to understand the classâs objectives.

"The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of ""systems that use mechanical parts"" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a ""blimp-like vehicle"" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has ""temperatures average over 800 degrees"" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation. If the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience, the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis.",0,1
"Decisions, Decisions

Nothing is worse than a problem that requires you to choose between multiple things. Sometimes you need a little guidance so you can stay on the right course. We can't view asking for help or advice as a weakness. We first need to observe the benefits. Wisdom, different perspectives and satisfaction are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions is so great.

Wisdom plays a big role in decision making.

There are people that have been through what you are going through, and can give you sound advice. This advice can be better than normal advice because not only do they understand the situation, they probably know what you've been going through on top of that. These people have learned from mistakes they have made, and know how to avoid them. Seeking an opinion from someone with experience will always be a sound decision.

We often count out people with opinions that aren't similar ours, but we fail to realize the reason for varying perspectives.

When faced with a decision to make, no matter how small, our judgment can become clouded.

To another person who isn't dealing with that problem at first hand, things look a little clearer for them.

They can provide an unbiased opinion that you probably needed.

These people can also open you up to ideas that you hadn't even considered.

When it's all said and done, sometimes we don't end up with the outcome we would have preferred. But knowing that you tried the hardest you could and exhausted every possible resource leaves you with a slight satisfaction. Seeking out multiple opinions may not have gotten you what you wanted, but you can move forward with this new information feeling better about yourself, and better about the future.

With all this new information, you can now face your problem head-on and know just what to do. We've established that there are a multitude of benefits to seeking multiple different opinions.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities.

"The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although many people believes that Churchill's statement is wrong, I believe in the important role that failure plays in people's lives to be successful in the future. In fact of the society, failure is a bad experience, however, I believe that failure is a way to help people to grow in personally, to be more successfully, and teaches you how to be mannerly.

Every single day, we are exposed to a reality that can be favorable or unfortunate. Where people need to learned about their failures, and grow personally from their new experiences. They made you more mature. That can be the example of my aunt, a nice woman who had an accident in the past. She was traumatized after that accident, but that never stop her to receive professional help with enthusiasm and do what she likes to do, helps others. My aunt understood that everything is possible if we do not loss our enthusiasm, and our pleasure to be success.

Life treat of deal with all unexpected situations. Failures that people never thought that could happen to them. However, everything depends on your enthusiasm, if you want to stay in the same place or learned about your failure and keep going until you accomplish your dreams. Generic_Name, a friend, is an example of the statement just mentioned. Generic_Name wanted to pass his classes in order to graduate. Generic_Name's teachers always told him that he was wasting his time if he was planning to go to the university, but Generic_Name never loss his hopes. Generic_Name became more expert in every subject, he graduated. Moreover, he demonstrated that everybody could be successful, if they try their best.

Everything has two faces, like a coin. As failures can be bad experiences, they can also be helpful if we look at them with good eyes, and if we receive them with good manners. People need to realize that the way in which a thing is happening is not bad at all. Things happens to foment our self and made us more mature. An example of this can be all of us. When we are passing for a bad moment we need to control our behavior, take a rest and think in a positive way to be successful.

In conclusion, Churchill's statement is more than right. Do not pay to much attention to the different failures and keep going with enthusiasm, is the key to be successful in life. Accomplish a dream that we are fighting for, is the best that could happen to everybody. That is why we do not need to discourage and loss our enthusiasm just for a failure that happened to us.

"Hey fellow citizes,

We got a big problem on our hands. Cars. They're everywhere. And they're ruining our planet. We gotta limit car usage or else we'll be in big trouble.

First off, cars are a major source of air pollution. They release harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, transportation is responsible for 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. That's a huge chunk! And cars are the main culprit.

But it's not just the air pollution that's the problem. Cars are also a major source of traffic congestion. Have you ever sat in traffic, stuck in your car for hours, wondering why you even bothered leaving the house? It's a huge waste of time and it's causing us all a lot of stress. In fact, according to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average commuter in the US spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic. That's like, a whole extra work week!

And let's not forget about the accidents. Cars are involved in a lot of accidents, and they can be deadly. In 2019, there were over 36,000 fatal car crashes in the US alone. That's a lot of lives lost, and it's a huge burden on our healthcare system.

So what can we do about it? We need to limit car usage. We can start by investing in public transportation. Buses and trains are way more efficient than cars, and they produce a lot less pollution. We can also encourage people to carpool, bike, or walk to work. And we can make sure that our cities are designed in a way that promotes walkability and bikeability.

But it's not just about the environment. Limiting car usage can also save us money. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average American household spends over $8,000 per year on transportation. That's a lot of cash! If we can reduce our reliance on cars, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and parking.

In conclusion, cars are a big problem. They're polluting our air, causing traffic congestion, and getting into accidents. We need to limit car usage and invest in alternative modes of transportation. It's good for the environment, our health, and our wallets. So let's all do our part and try to use our cars a little less. We can make a difference, one car at a time.

"Agree

There is no question that successful people are always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. They know that in order to achieve even more success, they need to take risks and try new things. This can be a scary proposition for some, but those who are successful understand that there is always something to be learned from trying new things.

For example, consider the story of Bill Gates. Gates was already a successful entrepreneur when he decided to start a new company, Microsoft, in the early 1980s. This was a huge risk, given the competitive landscape at the time, but Gates was able to see the potential in the personal computer market and was willing to take a chance. The rest, of course, is history, and Microsoft has become one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another example is Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group. Branson is a serial entrepreneur, and he has started dozens of businesses over the years. Many of these businesses have been successful, but some have failed. What sets Branson apart is his willingness to try new things and take risks. For instance, he started Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, when no one thought it was possible to compete with the big airlines. But Branson was not afraid to take a chance, and Virgin Atlantic is now one of the leading airlines in the world.

There are countless other examples of successful people who have taken risks and tried new things. The key takeaway is that successful people are always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and they are not afraid to take risks.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College. As a 6th grader, I have been learning about the Electoral College and its role in the presidential election process. After careful consideration, I believe that it is important to keep the Electoral College in place.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College is that it ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election. Without the Electoral College, larger states with more population would have more power in choosing the president, leaving smaller states with little to no say. This would be unfair to the citizens of those states, who would have no representation in the election. The Electoral College ensures that each state has a certain number of electoral votes, regardless of its population, giving smaller states a chance to have their voices heard.

Another reason I support the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states, not just those with the largest populations. This allows candidates to learn about the issues that are important to people in different parts of the country, and to develop a broader understanding of the needs of the nation. Without the Electoral College, candidates might only focus on the largest states and ignore the needs of smaller states.

I also believe that the Electoral College helps to prevent the president from being chosen based solely on popularity. Without the Electoral College, the president would be elected based on whoever receives the most votes nationwide. This could lead to a situation where a candidate with a strong following in one region of the country wins the election, even if they are not the best candidate for the job. The Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen based on a broader range of factors, including their qualifications, experience, and ability to represent the interests of all Americans.

Some people argue that the Electoral College is outdated and that we should switch to a popular vote system. However, I believe that this would lead to a system where the president is chosen based solely on who can get the most votes, rather than who is the best candidate for the job. This could lead to a situation where a candidate with a strong following in one region of the country wins the election, even if they are not the best candidate for the job.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an important part of the presidential election process and should be kept in place. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election, encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states, and helps to prevent the president from being chosen based solely on popularity. I urge you to consider these points and to keep the Electoral College in place.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,0
"Famous people are often treated unfairly by the media. The media is always looking for ways to sell newspapers or get people to watch their programs, and they will often invade the privacy of famous people in order to get a story. This is not fair to the people who have done nothing wrong and are just trying to live their lives.

The media should respect the privacy of famous people. These people are often in the public eye because they have done something to earn their fame, and they should not be treated like they are criminals. The media should be able to find other stories to write about, and they should not have to invade the privacy of famous people in order to get attention.

"The electoral college has many inherent flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttal to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unnecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes tenfold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.",0,1
"Introduction:

The Face on Mars has been a topic of debate for decades, with some people believing that it was created by aliens. However, as a scientist at NASA, I am convinced that the Face is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will provide evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to support my claims.

Body:

Firstly, the article states that the Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976 by the Viking 1 spacecraft. At that time, the image was low resolution and did not provide a clear picture of the Face. However, in 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor captured high-resolution images of the Face, which revealed that it was just a natural formation. The article states that ""the high-resolution images showed that the Face was just a mesa, a flat-topped mountain that had been shaped by erosion over millions of years.""

Secondly, the article explains that the Face on Mars is not unique. There are many other similar formations on Mars that have been shaped by erosion. The article states that ""Mars is covered in mesas, buttes, and other formations that have been shaped by wind and water erosion. The Face is just one example of these formations.""

Lastly, the article explains that the Face on Mars is not symmetrical, which is a characteristic of artificial structures. The article states that ""if the Face had been created by aliens, it would be symmetrical, but it is not. The Face has an asymmetrical shape, which is a characteristic of natural formations.""

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. The high-resolution images captured by the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 showed that the Face was just a mesa that had been shaped by erosion over millions of years. Additionally, Mars is covered in similar formations that have been shaped by wind and water erosion. Finally, the asymmetrical shape of the Face is a characteristic of natural formations, not artificial ones. Therefore, it is clear that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but rather by natural processes.",1,0

"Texting and driving puts innocent lives at risk every day, Higher risk than drunk drivers. However, some people feel that creating a law against phone usage is violating personal rights. Others feel that banning someone from using their cell phones is equivalent to telling someone that they can't adjust their radio or talk to someone else in their car. However, using a phone, whether talking or texting, while driving can be dangerous to your family or friends in the car including you and the people of your surroundings. All of the damage you could cause and all that has been caused in the past can and still could be avoided by simply pulling over.

"There are a few reasons why family members in the western world are required to tell their cancer patients the truth about the condition. First, cancer is a serious and often fatal disease. It is important for family members to be aware of the risks that their loved one may face if they are diagnosed with the disease. Additionally, cancer is a disease that can be treated and cured. If family members do not tell their loved one about the cancer, they may not be able to receive the treatment that they need and may even die from the disease. Finally, family members in the western world are often used to assuming that their loved ones know about and are able to deal with all sorts of illnesses. This is not always the case with cancer. In the Chinese culture, there is a custom of not telling the patient the truth. This custom may be based on the belief that cancer is a mysterious and difficult disease to understand. However, in my opinion, this custom is not necessary. In fact, I believe that it is important for family members to tell their cancer patients the truth about the condition. This way, the patients can have a better understanding of the situation and can make the best decisions for themselves.

"Introduction:
Hey there! I'm super excited to share my thoughts on the Face on Mars with you. I know some people think it was created by aliens, but let me tell you, it's actually just a natural landform. I've read the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and I'm here to convince you that it's not as extraterrestrial as it seems.

Claim 1: The Face on Mars is not a perfect representation of a human face.
The article mentions that the Face is not a perfect representation of a human face, and that it lacks defining features such as nostrils, a mouth, and eyebrows. If it were created by aliens, wouldn't they have made it look more, well, alien-like? It just doesn't make sense that an advanced civilization would create something so... ordinary.

Evidence: The article states, ""The 'Face' is nothing more than a low-relief, eroded hill that resembles a human face only in the most basic sense."" (para. 7)

Claim 2: The Face on Mars is made of natural materials.
The article goes on to explain that the Face is made of natural materials, including iron oxide and magnesium. These materials are commonly found on Mars and can be easily formed into hills and valleys through natural geological processes. It's not like aliens would need to bring their own materials to build a face, right?

Evidence: The article states, ""The 'Face' is composed of a series of hills and valleys, formed from the erosion of the surrounding terrain, and is made of the same materials as the surrounding terrain."" (para. 5)

Claim 3: The Face on Mars has been changing over time.
The article also mentions that the Face has been changing over time due to natural weathering processes. If it were created by aliens, wouldn't they have made it more permanent? It just doesn't seem logical that they would create something that could be easily erased by the wind and sand.

Evidence: The article states, ""The 'Face' has undergone significant changes over the past few decades, with parts of it eroding away and new features forming."" (para. 10)

Conclusion:
So there you have it! The Face on Mars is not a creation of aliens, but rather a natural landform that has been shaped by the planet's geological processes. I hope I've convinced you that it's not as extraterrestrial as it seems. Next time you look up at the stars, remember that there's still so much we don't know about our own planet and the wonders it holds. Thanks for listening!",1,0
"Nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. There is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. However, I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work.

One reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. They will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. Spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. They will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. Students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. Students

Another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. Students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. Evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. Students will not turn homework or projects on time. Students deserve to have extra time to study.

Final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. Students work to be independent. Students work to pay for their future education. Students work to help their families financial. Students work to achieve their future goals. They work to not have a miserable life in their future. Work will give them more opportunities in their life.

To conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. Students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. Schools should think a little bit more about student's responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life. I know that the education is very important ,but student deserve to make their own decisions. ",0,1
"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",0,1
"The debate over whether drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle has been a contentious issue for quite some time. While some argue that it is a necessary convenience in today's fast-paced world, others claim that it is a dangerous distraction that puts lives at risk. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction. According to studies, texting and driving is equivalent to driving blindfolded for five seconds at a time. This means that drivers who are texting or talking on their phones are significantly increasing their chances of getting into an accident. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that distracted driving, which includes cell phone use, was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017. This is a staggering number, and it highlights the dangers of using cell phones while driving.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving impairs a driver's reaction time. When a driver is focused on their phone, they are not paying attention to the road and may not react quickly enough to unexpected events. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the road, a driver who is texting may not have enough time to react and stop their vehicle before hitting the pedestrian. This is especially concerning in school zones, where children may suddenly dart into the road without warning.

In addition, using a cell phone while driving sets a bad example for young drivers. Teenagers are already at a higher risk of getting into accidents due to their inexperience behind the wheel. If they see their parents or other adults using cell phones while driving, they may assume that it is acceptable behavior and follow suit. This can lead to a cycle of distracted driving that puts everyone on the road at risk.

Finally, there are alternatives to using cell phones while driving. Drivers can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets or voice-to-text technology, to keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. They can also pull over to a safe location to take a call or send a text message. These alternatives allow drivers to stay connected without putting themselves or others in danger.

In conclusion, using cell phones while driving is a dangerous and unnecessary distraction. It impairs a driver's reaction time, sets a bad example for young drivers, and increases the risk of accidents. There are alternatives available that allow drivers to stay connected without putting themselves or others at risk. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.",1,0

For decades, teams from these two leagues have competed against each other in some thrilling matchups; however, none can match the intensity or importance of games between Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants and Chiba Lotte Marines. On April 5th every year since 1965, millions throughout Japan tune in to watch this special rivalry unfold as it commences with an opening day game at Tokyo Dome. As both teams take to the field surrounded by cheering crowds wearing their respective team colors, it brings out a unique atmosphere that cannot be found anywhere else in baseball competition outside Japan. It is not only on Opening Day when fans eagerly anticipate these matchups between Yomiuri Giants and Chiba Lotte Marines either; they occur several times throughout each season too. During these clashes there is always an electric vibe as both sides push themselves to play better than ever before while trying to best their opponents on any given night â something that makes them even more enjoyable to watch regardless which team you favor. The end result often becomes almost secondary when watching a matchup like this because everyone understands just how intense things can get during such big games with so much riding on them for players, coaches and fans alike!. The storied history between Yomiuri Giants vs Chiba Lotte Marines stands out among all other rivalries around Japan due its longevity over time combined with consistently entertaining matches that leave viewers enthralled until final pitch is thrown or ball crosses home plate for last run scored--whichever comes first!

"Giving back to one's community is a noble endeavor that can take many forms. It can be as simple as picking up litter in a park, or as involved as volunteering for a local non-profit organization. It can be done on a regular basis, or only when the need arises. No matter how it is done, community service is an important way to give back, and young people should be encouraged to do their part.

There are many reasons why young people should give back to their communities. For one, it is a way to show gratitude for all that the community has done for them. The community provides resources and opportunities that help young people grow and thrive. Giving back is a way of saying ""thank you"" for all that has been given.

In addition, community service is a way to give back in a way that is directly beneficial to others. When young people help with things like picking up litter, they are making their community a better place for everyone. This is especially important in low-income communities, where residents may not have the time or resources to keep their surroundings clean. By pitching in, young people can help make their community a better place for everyone.

Finally, community service is a great way to meet new people and make new friends. When young people help out at a local soup kitchen or after-school program, they are likely to meet other young people who share their commitment to giving back. These relationships can be valuable and lasting, and can help young people feel connected to their community.

There are many reasons why young people should give back to their communities. Community service is a way to show gratitude, give back in a direct and meaningful way, and meet new people. Young people who give back to their communities are sure to make a positive impact.

"Dear Fellow Citzens,

We all know that cars are a big part of our lives. They get us places fast and make our lifes alot easier. But have you ever thought about how cars are effecting the earth? There are alot of bad things that come from cars. They polute the air and make it harder to breathe. They use alot of gas which comes from fossil fuels which are running out. And they kill alot of people. Like, thousands of people die in car accidents every year. It's crazy.

We should limit car usage for a bunch of reasons. First off, it'll help the earth. If we all drove less, there would be less polution in the air. Plus, we wouldnt use as much gas and that means we wouldnt be using up all the fossil fuels so fast. And it would be safer. There would be fewer cars on the road, so there would be fewer accidents. It's a win-win.

Also, it would be good for our health. Walking and biking are great ways to exersise. If we did those things more, we would be alot healthier. And it would be good for the econimy too. If we all walked and biked more, we wouldnt have to pay so much for gas and car maintance. Think about it.

There are allready alot of ways we can limit car usage. We can carpool, use public transportation, and bike or walk when it's possible. Some cities even have bike lanes and stuff. We just need to start doing it more.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great way to help the earth and our health. It's good for the econimy too. We should all try to drive less and use other ways to get places.

"Often times, when we're looking for advice we talk to multiple people, why is that? When your looking for advice or a solution to a problem, do you talk to more than one person? If so, did that lead to a better result? In my experience talking to multiple people about a problem proved to be a good idea. I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of people's experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.

First off, one reason why you should seek multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice are people's experiences. People's experiences shape who they are, and determine how they respond to certain situations. Different people have different experiences, leading to different responses. Someone who has ran into your situation before will most likely give better advice than someone who's never been in that situation. People tell you to respect your elders because of all the experiences they've had, older people probably have a lot of solutions to problems you may have.

Secondly, another reason why you should talk to multiple people about a situation are perspectives. Every person has an unique perspective, influenced by their past experiences or current situation. For example, if two people went to the store, a three year old and a twenty one year old, their perspectives would be very different. Everybody looks at a situation from a different perspective, and that can prove useful when you're looking for advice. The way someone comprehends a situation can be heavily influenced by their perspective.

Lastly, there are people's backgrounds. Someone's background is made up of many different things including ethnicity, religion, or culture. Across cultures situations can be interpreted and handled differently, so someone's background can impact their interpretations of situations or problems. All this can lead to advice you wouldn't get from your own background. Someone's background plays a role in the first to things I mentioned, experience and perspective. People's unique backgrounds can give them unique experiences and perspectives, that might differ from your own.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to seeking multiple opinions when trying to make a good choice, and there are many things that can have an impact on the advice people may give you. If you didn't ask others for advice, you would only have your own knowledge to deal with your problems, instead of the world of knowledge at your disposal. I believe you should seek opinions from multiple people because of people's unique experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds.",0,1

"I believe that in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. There are many reasons for this prediction, but one of the most important reasons is that more and more people are choosing to live in cities. Cities are much more efficient than rural areas and they require less space to live in. This has led to the development of cities in many parts of the world, and the number of cars in use will decrease as a result.

Another reason for the decrease in the number of cars in use is the increase in the number of people. More and more people are choosing to live in cities, and this has led to the development of vehicles that are more efficient and accessible than those used in the past. This has made it easier for people to get to their destinations and have a more comfortable life.

Overall, I believe that in the next twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is because more people are choosing to live in cities, and this has led to the development of more efficient and accessible vehicles. This has made it easier for people to get to their destinations and have a more comfortable life.

"For centuries, man has been fascinated by the stars in the sky. From the earliest civilizations, people looked to the skies for answers. They worshipped the flaming sun and glowing moon. Later, this worship subsided, and looking to the skies took on a more scientific pursuit. Now, man has come to a time where they can visit the stars and planets. The author does not make Venus sound like a worthy pursuit, because the author is basing the article on the assmption that people should visit Venus.

The author gives three reasons for visiting Venus, and that is Venus is sometimes ""our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". Exploring Venus would help us learn more about the planet (paragraph 8) and encourage us to explore other intimidating areas (also paragraph 8). However, the last two reasons are tagged on at the very end, with little elaboration or mention in the essay. Furthermore the second reasoning is vague reasoning. The author should have used specific reasons instead of the umbrella phrase, such as learning why Venus has changed so much since their theoretical ocean covered past. Some of these can be inferred, but it's better to assume the reader knows nothing than expect them to know everything.

The other problem with this argument is the assumption that people would make a planetary visit. Save for the feel of adventure (and that would likely not make a profit based on the billions poured into these endeavors), the other reason a person would visit another planet is if they made their own planet inhospitable. It would be preferable if the government used some of the money given to NASA on projects relating to the Earth. For example, they could spend money on more efficient, sanitary, moral, and less pollutive techniques concerning meat production. They could spend some of the money on making cheap, biodegradable containers and utensils. They could use the money to subsidize fruit costs (they already do so for meat).

It would be nice if the government invested more money in figuring out how to get rid of the ring of trash around our atmosphere (from various space missions) before launching anything else.

The author does not make Venus sound like a worthy pursuit, because the author is basing the article on the single assumption that people should visit Venus. Though it is understandable that many would find fascination with expoloring beyond he outer realms of what is known, I don't think so much money should be poured into these endeavors. Much of Earth's polluting can be remedied, if the government put more money and effort into this.",0,1
"There are a few reasons why famous people may be treated unfairly by the media. Some people think that famous people are treated unfairly because they are not given enough privacy. They are often asked to do interviews and are often the focus of articles and videos. This can make them feel like they are not important or that they are not able to have a normal life.

Some people also think that the media is the price of fame. Famous people often have to give up a lot of their privacy in order to be a part of the media. This can make them feel like they are not wanted or that they are not allowed to have a normal life.

The current educational system in the US is largely unchanged since the 19th century, with students generally attending school five days per week from 8am to 3pm. Recently, some school districts have proposed altering this system by implementing a four-day school week with an extended two hours each day. While such a system could have several advantages, including reduced overhead costs and improved morale for teachers and students, it could also cause students to miss out on curriculum that may be important to attaining their academic goals. Additionally, it could increase the burden for parents who would be responsible for finding alternative care for their children on the fifth day of the school week. Ultimately, any decision to implement a four-day school week with extended days must weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages against the potential impacts it would have on student achievement.",1,0
"The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and anti-democratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states' existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.

The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.

In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.

The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.",0,1
"While the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto talks in great depth about the science behind how we make certain expressions and what a computer can do with that, the author does not mention what is really causing these emotions, whether it is happiness, anger, or disgust. However, the truth behind emotions like these is human interaction. Without it, a person might not feel anger or sadness, but they might not also feel happiness or joy. One movie called ""Interstellar"" shows a character who has spent years on a foreign planet without the ability to communicate with any other human being. When he is finally discovered, he mentions the horrible pain and loneliness that stemed from an absence of other people. Technology and robotic machines are being slowly integrated into every part of humans' lives, and perhaps there will be no more need for certain professions to be filled by actual people. While the use of the Facial Action Coding System might prove to help identify emotions, it would not be worthwhile in a classroom because it would require one-on-one interaction with a teacher and even transform the classroom into a robotic impersonal environment.

Even if the program would successfully be able to indetify emotions in a student, it would be near impossible for a teacher, robotic or otherwise, to react to each individual students' feelings. Perhaps the technology of facial recognition will eventually become efficient enough that it can read the emotions of a person in less than a second, but what good can this really do? A teacher only has so much time every day to interact with his or her students, and definitely not enough time to talk in length with each one individually. Dr. Huang, an expert mentioned in the article, tells the reader, Â'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" But what if there is only one student in the back of the class who is confused? The teacher cannot be expected to slow down the whole lesson for this one student and force the rest of the kids into boredom. The only time this might actually make a difference is if the entire class, or almost everyone, was confused and the teacher would then take the time to explain the lesson in greater detail. However, most teachers today already have the ability to read their students' emotions. It is not hard to discern when a full room of high schoolers, for example, needs further clarification. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" However, what he does not mention is the other portion of nonverbal communication: body language. That is, body language outside of facial expressions. A very large portion of the way humans express themselves is through body language such as crossing the arms across the chest, bouncing a leg when he or she is bored, etc. Technology doesn't have the capability to analyze this yet. Perhaps it will someday, but for now, attempting to bring this program into the classroom would be unnecessary and potentially expensive and time-consuming.

Additionally, for this program to be most successful, teachers would likely be gradually phased out and replaced by virtual or robotic instructors, an idea that, while perhaps more efficient, will create an impersonal environment in the classroom. Using this program or not, there is no doubt that many people have speculated about the use of robotic teachers sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even Dr. Huang mentions it in the article when he says, Â'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The use of this program would encourage the replacement of human teachers. However, is this really the best direction to go? If a random student was asked to think back to their favorite class period, it is fairly plausible that they would mention something about an actual teacher. Maybe the teacher participated in a fun activity with the students or told a funny joke. Either way, the experience of interacting with real human teachers is simply irreplacable. The author, Nick D'Alto, later goes on to state, ""Empathy (feeling someone elseÂs emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another personÂs facial expressions."" As mentioned in a previous paragraph, human interaction is one of the most significant reasons humans are capable of feeling true emotions. Ask anyone what their best memory is and they are almost certain to mention something with another person whether it be a family member, spouse, or close friend. Empathy, as D'Alto touches on, is essential to feeling emotions with the people around one another. So much of these necessary actions would be taken away once real teachers are replaced by artificial ones. It would take almost all remaining enjoyment out of school and form an environment in classrooms that is lacking feelings and is uninviting.

In summary, integrating the Facial Action Coding System into the classroom is impractical and unnecessary. That is not to say that the program does not have many uses in other areas of the world, but its uses in the classroom are minimal. It would waste time and effort for a result that is not notably helpful. Perhaps the developers should first focus on its other uses such as on a website or in video games instead of in the classroom. Schools do not need programs like this and they will only eliminate the living breathing system that is already in place.",0,1
"I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed.

The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm.

"""HEY, WHAT TO I NEED TO DO!"".

People often attain confusion, but why be brain stumped just ask friends, family, or even your co-workers for their opinion. It is excellent to ask a question if you cannot decide what to do, but you do not have to be embarrassed just because you asked a question. You never access knowledge unless you ask a question. There are three reasons why you need to ask for multiple opinions you can have a variety of choices to choose from, you do not have to make a poor decision that will leave you with a lifetime flaw, and if a plan that you tried multiple times fails, you will always have a back-up plan.

First, the idea of having multiple choices is an excellent idea. Its similar to deciding what restaurantÂ you crave, Longhorn Steakhouse or Outback Steakhouse. Longhorn may attain lower prices, but Outback attains outstanding quality. Also, having multiple choices endures the responsibility of constructing your own choices. Choices are based off of assumptions and also what ones' reactions are, one is more remarkable than the other, that one has a more outstanding design, or this one has a astronomical quality. Choices are difficult to make, but they will not kill you.

Secondly, making poor decisions can always be costly, somehow and someway. Constructing a poor decision is either going to finish outstanding or in an extreme consequence, think of it as your going to end up in Heaven or Hell. Heaven, finishing outstanding, is going to be an excellent life, while Hell, finishing in an extreme consequence, is not going to turn out so excellent. When having multiple opinions make sure you decide on the correct opinion and not the one that will strand you on an island.

Finally, it is always excellent to have a back-up plan. When your primary idea, plan A, does not always have an excellent ending make sure you have an intermediate plan, plan B, in reach. You will not always finish first in life, but as long as you attain an excellent back-up plan, you will have an excellent chance of doing so.

Think of it as Trump, every time he fails he has another plan just in grasp.

In conclusion, it is an excellent idea to have more than one opinion on board. It may never work out the way you wanted it to, but that is how life is, not fair. Just make sure you have another opinion in grasp, just like Trump. Yet, choices are tough, bitter, or disatorous, but as long as there are mutiple opinions we will make it through life.",0,1

Winston Churchill once famously stated, âSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.â Churchill's words provide a great reminder of the importance of failure in achieving success. Failure is essential to success because it helps us to develop skills, to learn resilience, and to become better problem-solvers. 

Take, for example, Thomas Edison's lightbulb. Edison famously said, âI have not failed. Iâve just found 10,000 ways that wonât work.â After thousands of trials and errors, Edison eventually achieved success. Had he given up at the first few attempts of failure, he would have never created the lightbulb, one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the late 19th century. 

Similarly, the film industry is filled with stories of those who found success after a history of failure. Steven Spielberg was turned down by the University of Southern Californiaâs film school three times, and was rejected from Universal Studios numerous times before making his first feature-length film. 

These examples demonstrate that Churchill's statement holds true: it is only through the courage to continue, even in the face of failure, that success can be achieved.",1,0
"There is no one right way to be successful in life. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Some of the most successful people in the world have taken risks and tried new things, even if it did not always work out. For example, Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, started out as a computer programmer and software entrepreneur. He risked his money and invested in new technology, which eventually paid off big time. Gates is now one of the richest people in the world and a philanthropist.

Similarly, Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is well-known for his investment strategies. He is known for investing in companies that are not well known by the public, and for waiting for these companies to become profitable before selling them. Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and his investments have paid off time and time again.

These examples show that taking risks and trying new things is key to being successful. Successful people are not afraid to experiment and take risks, which is why they are often successful.

Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them.

Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole.

Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do.

If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible.

Going out after midnight is not being responsible. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night.

I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good.

Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen.

Going outside after midnight is very dangerous.

Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night.

There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night.

"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmosphere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town carfree. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completely true since plugin cars, hybrids, and other earthfriendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of fossil fuelpowered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.",0,1
"If we look at official statistics of the industrialised and developing world, we immediately realize that the number of cars has been constantly increasing over time. In the United States, for example, the average age of a car has increased from 4.5 years in 1950 to 6.3 years today, while in the UK it has risen from 5.4 years to 7.2 years. The average length of time for a new car to be on the road has also increased over the same period, from 3.6 years for the 1950s to 4 years and 6 months for today's cars.

"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an article about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify human emotions. This means that computers can use it to see how we are feeling by our facial expressions. I think that using this technology in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students can be valuable for some reasons.

Firstly, the Facial Action Coding System could help teachers understand how their students feel about a certain topic. For example, if a teacher is talking about history and sees that some of the students are bored, they can change the topic or make it more interesting to keep the students engaged. This will make learning more fun for the students and help them understand the topics better.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System is a useful tool for identifying when someone needs emotional support. Sometimes it's not easy for students to ask for help when they need it. They might be afraid of looking weak or being ridiculed by their classmates. This technology can help teachers spot these students and offer them the emotional support that they need to get through difficult times.

Lastly, the Facial Action Coding System might help students who struggle with communication skills. Sometimes it can be difficult to express our feelings using words, especially if we have trouble with language or social skills. This technology could identify the emotions a person is feeling, and then help them find the right words to express it.

In conclusion, I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom could be very useful if implemented correctly. It would enable teachers to understand their students' feelings better, offer emotional support to those who need it, and help those who have trouble communicating. Although some people may be concerned about privacy and the ethical implications of using such technology, the benefits could be significant.""",1,0
"Phones & Driving

Drivers shouldn't use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers shouldn't use phones, because drivers hands-free technology is easy to use and is widely available, drivers should take passengers into consideration and having your phone in your hand slows down people's reaction time. These reasons don't allow drivers to keep themselves or others safe.

Drivers shouldn't be using phones while driving, because hands-free technology is easy to use and is available to all. A lot of car brands use technology that connects people's phones to the vehicle's stereo system. In older vehicles models people can use bluetooth technology that allows people to use their phones hands free. By using this technology people are less distracted and more focused on driving. This can allow drivers to avoid accidents or life threatening events.

Those who drive vehicles should consider their passengers and not use phones. Having passengers is a serious responsibility and using phones can put them at risk of being involved in an accident. Many deaths are caused by drivers using their cell phones. Using phones can risk the lives of pedestrians if drivers are not careful or paying attention.

Drivers also decrease their chances of reacting to certain situations while driving if their attention is on their phone. People are more likely to get involved in accidents, because their reactions will be too late. Drivers are also likely to miss flashing lights and risk their safety to maintain a safe position in a driving lane. Using phones also cause drivers to slow down on speed and cause accidents with those going on a constant speed.

Drivers or anyone learning to operate a vehicle should not be able to use their phones. Using phones can cause serious injuries to themselves and others around them. By using updated technology and avoiding phones, drivers can drive safely and keep other drivers and passengers safe as well 1",0,1

"Dear Senator,

I am writting to you today to share my opinion on the Electoral College. I think that we should keep the Electoral College the way it is. One of the main reasons why is because it makes sure that smaller states have a say in the election. If we didn't have the Electoral College, then the presedent would only have to worry about the big states and the smaller ones would be left out. This would be unfair to the people who live in those states.

Another reason why the Electoral College is good is because it makes the election more fair. If we had a popular vote system, then the person who wins would be the one who gets the most votes overall. But that wouldn't be fair because some states have way more people than others. For example, Californa has a lot more people than Wyoming, so if we had a popular vote system, then the presedent would probibly be from Californa and the people in Wyoming would have no say in the matter.

I also want to address the counterclaim that the Electoral College is outdated. I don't think this is true because it was made for a reason. It was made to make sure that smaller states have a say in the election and to make the election fair. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's not still useful.

I also want to point out that the Electoral College has been useful in the past. For example, in the 2000 election, George W. Bush won the presidency because of the Electoral College, even though Al Gore got more popular votes. This shows that the Electoral College can make a difference and it's important to have it.

In conclusion, I think that we should keep the Electoral College the way it is. It's fair, it makes sure that smaller states have a say in the election, and it's been useful in the past. I hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the Electoral College.

"Quite often, we find ourselves needing advice on things we don't know much about. On certain occasions, we search for more than one person for it. People may end up gaining multiple viewpoints from doing such, as well as grasping a better understanding on a matter. They may also think their final decisions over more thoroughly.

When multiple people are questioned about a matter, it's not all likely for all of them to have the same viewpoints. In that way, someone looking for advice from multiple people could possibly gain a more unbiased and logical opinion. From an unbiased standpoint, someone could see a situation with an open mindedÂ view.

Questioning multiple people for advice often gives more information on the topic itself. When more is known, it's practical for someone to feel less confused than they may have been before they began asking others for help and advice. One may also feel more at ease with knowing more than less.

A person who may not know how to handle a certain situation may become stressed from the lack of knowledge and experience. With acquired information and opinion, it generally becomes easier to ponder over a situation at hand. While knowing the pros and cons, someone could figure a decision that would be best for them and others involved, if anyone at all.

From derived information one could obtain by looking at multiple views, one could gain more knowledge, peace, and less bias overall. In conclusion, it would be a better idea to search advice on situations from multiple people, if possible, than over a singular individual, to avoid bias.",0,1
"They say Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Its a crucial consideration given the long time frames of spave travel. The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0,1

"Traveling is one of the most exciting and enriching experiences one can have. It allows us to explore new cultures, meet new people, and broaden our horizons. However, when it comes to traveling, there are different ways to do it. Some prefer to travel alone, while others prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. In my opinion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. In this essay, I will explain why I believe so.

Firstly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to learn about the history and culture of the place you are visiting. A tour guide is an expert in the local history and culture and can provide valuable insights into the places you visit. They can tell you about the significance of the landmarks, the customs and traditions of the locals, and the history of the region. This can help you appreciate the place you are visiting more deeply and make your trip more meaningful.

Secondly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to meet new people. When you travel alone, you may feel lonely and isolated, especially if you are in a foreign country where you don't speak the language. However, when you travel in a group, you have the opportunity to meet people from different parts of the world who share your interests. This can lead to new friendships and connections that can last a lifetime.

Thirdly, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to stay safe. When you travel alone, you are more vulnerable to theft, scams, and other dangers. However, when you travel in a group led by a tour guide, you have someone who knows the local area and can help you avoid dangerous situations. They can also provide you with important safety tips and advice that can help you stay safe during your trip.

Finally, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a great way to save time and money. When you travel alone, you may spend a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to get around, where to eat, and what to see. However, when you travel in a group led by a tour guide, they can take care of all these details for you. They can arrange transportation, book hotels and restaurants, and plan your itinerary, saving you time and money.

In conclusion, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. It allows you to learn about the history and culture of the place you are visiting, meet new people, stay safe, and save time and money. Of course, there are some downsides to traveling in a group, such as less flexibility and less freedom. However, in my opinion, the benefits of traveling in a group led by a tour guide far outweigh the drawbacks.

"In a society where things are always changing and schedules are always busy, cars and other personal motor vehicles have become a necessity. It seems as if cars have become a necessary mean for survival, rendering as important as something imperative like oxygen or water. Many families even have multiple cars in order to get to where the need to go. Even though cars have been so convenient and beneficial for people all over the world, there are some factors of cars that produce a negative effect. By eliminating or largly reducing car usage, the world would be more safe, more ecofriendly, and save the precious natural gases that the Earth provides.

For years people have been driving, and while most do it safely, some do it recklessly and do not abide by the rules, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. Reckless driving, careless driving, and driving under the influence has become one of the leading causes of death among young people, making many very skeptical or cautious about driving. Millions of people are lost each year in car accidents, leaving behind family members and loved ones to grieve in their place. If cars were to be eliminated from the equation, all of these deaths could easily be avoided. By walking, riding bicycles, taking the bus or subway, or even a trolley or ferry, there will be an ensured reduction of accidents and an increase in safety and peace of mind.

In addition to increased safety, there would also be a significant reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases and smog have been polluting the atmosphere especially since the coming about of cars. It says in source four that transportation produces half of America's carbon emission. If car usage were to be limited or eliminated, there would be a noticeable and significant decrease in the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Similarly, source one states that, "" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" If cars were to be ridden of, there would be much less green house gas poluting the atmosphere, therefore creating a cleaner environment and a brighter and longer future for the generations to come.

Similarly, the removal of cars from the world would mean the preservation of nonrenewable resources. Since cars run on gasoline, diesel, and other natural gases, the resources are being burned up faster than they can replenish themselves. There are other things that rely on the natural gases to work, cars included. If cars were to be eliminated, and not use the gases at the rapid rate that they do, there would be a huge reduction in the usage for fossil fuels, therefore preserving the remaining resources and only using them when mandatory. This would allow the natural gases to slowly increase and be able for use in the future.

In conclusion, the limitations of car usage would make a significant change in the way the world runs, however there would be many positive outcomes to it. Not only would it ensure a brighter, longer, and more promising future for the coming generations, but it would also relieve stress and worrying and grant peace of mind to many. Although there is no way to take back the damage already done to the Earth, this would greatly reduce the potential damage that could be done, and protect the future. It would provide oppurtunities for a a cleaner atmosphere, safer life, living in harmony with the ecosystem, and a chance to respect and protect the Earth we live on.",0,1
"I believe that education is a lifelong process. To begin with, education is not a one time event. It is a continuous process that one must continue throughout their life. The more education one receives, the more opportunities they have for success. This is evident by looking at the people who have gone through the most education. They have achieved the most success in their fields.

One example of this is Bill Gates. Gates is one of the richest people in the world and he has earned this money through his work in the computer industry. Gates has a degree in computer science from Harvard University. This is just one example of how a degree from a prestigious university can help you achieve success.

There are countless other examples of people who have achieved success because of their education. A person who is educated can find a job that matches their skills and interests. They can also find a job that allows them to use their education to help them become successful.

There are many reasons why I believe that education is a lifelong process. First, education is not a one time event. It is a continuous process that one must continue throughout their life. This is evident by looking at the people who have gone through the most education. They have achieved the most success in their fields.

Second, education is not just about learning information. It is also about developing skills and abilities. This is why education is important for people who want to find a job that matches their skills and interests. A person who is educated can find a job that allows them to use their education to help them become successful.

Third, education is a source of pride. It is a way for people to show off their skills and abilities. This is why education is important not only for people who want to find a job, but for people who want to become successful. A degree from a prestigious university can help you achieve success.

All of these reasons make me believe that education is a lifelong process. I believe that education is important for people of all ages. It is a way for people to achieve their goals and to become successful.

"There are many people who say that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"", because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. I do not agree with this statement, because I believe that we are just using more plastic bags than necessary.

One reason that I do not believe that we are a ""throw-away society"" is because we are using more plastic bags than necessary is because the bags actually help us to keep our environment clean. For example, if we were to use paper bags instead of plastic bags, then we would have to go through the trouble of putting all of our food in separate bags and then carrying them around with us, which would be a lot of work. However, with the use of plastic bags, we can just put all of our food in one bag and then throw the bag away when we are done. This way, we are not having to waste any time or energy, and our environment is still clean.

Another reason that I do not believe that we are a ""throw-away society"" is because we are filling up our landfills with so much rubbish. In fact, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we are currently using more plastic than paper in our country. This is because plastic is stronger and can last longer than paper, which is why we are increasingly using it to make products such as packaging. However, if we were to stop using plastic bags and start using paper bags instead, we would be able to reduce the amount of rubbish that we are throwing away, and this would help to preserve our environment.

Overall, I do not believe that we are a ""throw-away society"" because we are using more plastic than necessary, and we are filling up our landfills with rubbish. I believe that we are just using more plastic bags than necessary, and this is because they are actually helpful to us and our environment.

The first experiment was conducted on the interior of a frog. We examined the heart rate of the frog before and after stimulation of its legs with a paintbrush. We found that the heart rate of the frog increased once stimulation was applied. This gives evidence to show that the movements of the legs are related to stimulation of the heart.

The second experiment involved using a flashlight and a liquid. When the flashlight was shone onto the liquid, the liquid glowed in a specific color. This was because the liquid had a property called fluorescence which made it glow in response to the light. This showed that depending on the type of liquid, different colors could be observed when a light is shone onto it.",1,0

"Mapping the Thoughts of Students

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" advancing technology used for recognizing human emotion is suggested for use in the classroom. By having a computer be able to register the emotions of a student and adjust the lesson accordingly using a program called Facial Action Coding System, student productivity will excel, and the stress felt by teachers will ease.

Lessons, for as long as education has existed, have been adjusted accordingly to the audience by the tutors. For instance, a teacher may observe their students leaning forward in interest of the lesson, and may continue based off of that subject. Others may see students slump in their chairs, or watch with glossy, bored eyes, and will attempt to reconnect with the class. Facial recognition is already common. ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day (Paragraph 5)."" But it is done ineffectively in the classroom due to one person teaching twenty others. A computer is unbiased, and only focuses on one body: The user. By reading and calculating the most subtle changes in one's face, beyond what the naked eye can see, a computer is able to follow ""emotion algorithms"" and change the lesson's strategy ""...like an effective human instructor (Paragraph 6)."" The lesson becomes personalized, benefiting the student greatly, as if they had their own private tutor. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (Paragraph 6)."" The student will understand quicker and learn at a greater rate than if they simply sat and listened to an adult stand at the front of the classroom.

In turn, this student productivity will drastically lower the stress and pressure a teacher will feel over their students. Teachers, more often than not, truly care if their students understand what is being taught and want to see them succeed. Teachers, however, do not have the time to focus on each student individualy. By watching a student fail, a teacher feels as if they themselves are failing. With emotion tracking classroom computers, each student has a better chance of succeeding. A student, who has mastered balancing chemical equations, will no longer have to 'start back at square one' with another student who knows nothing of math or chemistry. Students who fall behind more often will be more equal with their quicker classmates. On a whole, the class itself will be more productive, and the teacher may even be able to move on and prepare more advanced lessons. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (Paragraph 4)."" The focus the computer has on the student can be greater, and more effective, than what a single adult can provide. Teachers will feel more at ease knowing their students have the 'attention' they need for more challenging subjects.

Facial recognition is not a new concept, and has existed even before the invention of computers. Efficiency is what has been changing, and for the better. If computers, able to recognize and adapt according the user's emotions, better a student's productivity and reduce a teacher's stress, Facial Action Coding Systems are of great value in the classroom.",0,1
"It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns. Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during next two decades. The trend of using cell phones has increased throughout the world. One of the primary reasons for the gigantic growth of cell phones is that they facilitate communication offering high levels of flexibility reaching desired person within seconds whether he/she is at office, home, or outside driving a car etc. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectively and without wastage of any time. Other main reason for the explosive growth of cell phones is the safety aspect. Cell phones make it easy to contact during emergency even during driving although using cell phone while driving is mostly dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency, listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes etc.

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating while increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers have also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and adjusting accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death.

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic.

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. Based on arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.",0,1
"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially carless suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and global warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was nearrecord pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular carfree day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",0,1
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a really cool thing. It can detect emotions on people's faces and it's like a computer can read your mind. The article says it's like a game changer. But, I'm not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom.

First of all, it's kinda creepy. Imagine if a computer is watching you all the time and can tell what you're feeling. It's like Big Brother is always watching you. It's like you can't even have a secret. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks you're feeling sad when you're actually just tired? That could be really embarrassing.

But, on the other hand, it could be useful. If a teacher can see that a student is feeling upset, they can help them. Maybe the student is struggling with a concept and the teacher can explain it in a different way. Or maybe the student is feeling bullied and the teacher can step in and help. It's like having a superpower.

Also, it could be fun. Imagine if you could play games that use the Facial Action Coding System. You could play a game where you have to make different emotional expressions and the computer has to guess what you're feeling. It would be like a reverse version of ""Guess Who"" where the computer is trying to guess who you are.

In conclusion, I think the Facial Action Coding System is a cool technology but it's not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom. It could be useful but it could also be creepy and embarrassing. But, it could also be fun. It's a hard decision and I'm not sure what I would choose. Maybe we could just use it for games and not for real life.",1,0
"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmosphere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town carfree. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completely true since plugin cars, hybrids, and other earthfriendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of fossil fuelpowered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.",0,1
"Dear State Senator,

I am writting to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I think it's a good idea to keep it the way it is. I know some people think it's unfair but I don't agree.

First of all, the Electoral College makes sure that the President has to win support from a lot of different places. If we just had a popular vote, the President would only have to worry about the biggest states and the people in the smaller states would get ignored. This way, the President has to care about everyone.

Another thing is that the Electoral College helps to keep the country together. If we didn't have it, the President would just be chosen by the most populous states and the other states would feel left out. This way, everyone gets a say.

I know some people say that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it means that the President can win without getting the most votes. But, as the article we read in class said, that's not always true. In fact, it's only happened a few times in history. And when it does happen, it's usually because the election is really close and the Electoral College helps to make sure that the President is chosen fairly.

I also want to say that changing to a popular vote system would be hard to do. It would take a lot of work and it might even cause some problems. For example, the article we read said that some states might try to rig the election by giving their electoral votes to the candidate they like the most, even if the people in that state didn't vote for them.

So, I think it's best to keep the Electoral College the way it is. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And it's been around for a long time, so it must be doing something right.

Thank you for listening to my opinion. I hope you will consider what I said when you're making your decision.

"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" argues why humans should research Venus, despite the difficulties that may follow. The author provides information about Venus and what makes it such a hard planet to explore, but more importantly, why that should not stop researchers and scientists. Through the author's compelling argument, readers are able to form their own opinion of whether Venus should be explored. The author supports the idea of studying Venus well by dicussing benefits, ways to avoid dangers on Venus, and future experiments, all while including strong evidence and interesting hooks to captivate the readers.

After sharing information about Venus, the author begins to discuss the benefits of exploring the planet. The author supports their argument well by giving compelling evidence to back up their statements and opinions. It is stated in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". This quote shows the value in exploring Venus, further supporting the author's argument. The article goes on to share another compelling reason; the fact that Venus is ""our nearest option for a planetary visit"", as stated in paragraph 4. The current limitations of space travel only allow for close visits for astronauts, making Venus a compelling planet. By discussing the benefits of exploring Venus and giving evidence to support it, the author starts off their argument very strong.

Next, the author shares how astronauts can get past the many dangers that Venus presents. This acts as a refutation for any arguments that claim Venus is too dangerous to explore. In paragraph 5, the author shares an idea of a blimp-like vehicle that would allow astronauts to survive. They state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". There are also other approaches that can be taken that the author shares. In paragraph 7, simplified electronics are discussed because of their ability to survive on Venus. This ongoing project shows that there are ways to explore Venus and that the idea is not entirely impossible. The author also brings in evidence to support their claim by sharing the science behind simplified electronics. This shows that the statements made are not false and allows for the readers to understand how the electronics work. These refuations leave no doubt for any other arguments, creating a stronger support.

The author later compels the readers with motivation and inspiration by arguing that the challenges should only bring more drive to explore the impossible. In paragraph 8, they state, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". The author is able to finally bring to rest the argument that Venus is too dangerous to explore. More importantly, it also shows the emotion that the author brings into the paper. All throughout the article, the author uses many hooks in order to draw the reader in. This technique makes the article more approchable and altogether much more interesting. Discussing the value in exploring Venus allows readers to believe that humans are capable of surpassing the challenges, despite the odds. It also draws more interest in, as not all people who read the article will be interested in space or the importance of it. Even if someone who reads the article is not interested, they will at least be inspired at the end. The last sentence in the article states ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Imagination and innovation appeal to everyone, allowing for a stronger arguement that will presuade anyone who reads the article.

Overall, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a very presuasive article. The paper starts off with information about Venus, drawing the reader in. The author explains the reasons why humans should not be daunted by the nature of the planet, and goes on to give evidence to support their reasons. Solutions are given in order to survive Venus' challenges in order to refute any arguments against their claims. Lastly, the author uses strong hooks and compelling arguments that appeal to anyone in order to create a persuasive article that interests the reader from beginning to end. The idea that Venus should be explored is well supported in the article, leaving no one to be against it.",0,1

The sciences are vast and wide, with a variety of topics such as biology, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. To investigate these topics, one would use various methods and tools. ""Scintilla,"" meaning a tiny spark or trace, can be used as a metaphor for the bits of knowledge acquired from investigating these areas of study. 

Scientific notation is also used to give an exact format for writing and expressing large numbers. For example, writing 6,000,000,000 to the power of 10 is expressed as 6 x 10^10. This is used when discussing topics such as astronomy, where distances in light-years away are often measured in this format. 

Science also heavily impacts our day-to-day life, from the air we breathe to the food we eat, it all comes from science. Not only that, but the clothing and materials we use, the medicines and vaccines that keep us safe, and the technologies we use to stay connected are all a result of science.

Becoming an expert in the sciences requires dedication and study over many years. Depending on the specialization, the time-frame varies. Generally, one may spend around five years on their undergraduate studies, six more for a Masters and another three to five for a PhD. 

There are also chain changes and bevels that contribute to the sciences. They both act as catalysts and create reactions within a specific project or area of study, which act as the building blocks to form the complete result.",1,0
"Do you think its a good idea for computer to be abel to read our emotions? Some peoples might say yes, but i think its a bad idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can read peoples emotions by looking at there face. Its like a computer can see how you feel. But what if you don't want it to know how you feel? What if you don't want people to no your secrets?

In the article it says that this technology can be used in a classroom to help teacher know if there students are understanding the material or not. But what if the student don't want to show there face? What if there shy or don't want to get caught not paying attention?

I think that this technology is a invasion of privacy. Its like the computer is watching you all the time. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks your happy when your really sad? Or what if it thinks your sad when your really happy?

I know some people might say that it will help teacher to help there students. But i think its not worth it. Its not worth giving up our privacy. We should have the right to keep our emotions to our self.

In conclusion, i think the use of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is not valuable. Its an invasion of privacy and could potently be misleading. We should focus on other ways to help students and teachers connect, like having real conversations and building realationships.",1,0
"Cell phones have become a big part of our lives, and it's not uncommon to see people using them everywhere, even while driving. But the question is, should drivers be allowed to use cell phones in any way while operating a vehicle? In my opinion, the answer is no.

First of all, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When you're behind the wheel, your main focus should be on the road and the other cars around you. If you're busy texting or talking on the phone, you're not paying attention to the road, and that can lead to accidents. Studies have shown that using a cell phone while driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving. That's why many states have laws against texting and driving, and some have even made it illegal to hold a cell phone while driving.

Another reason why drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving is that it's not just a risk for the driver, but also for other people on the road. If a driver is distracted by their phone, they might not see pedestrians, bicyclists, or other cars, and that can lead to serious injuries or even death. As a society, we have a responsibility to make sure that everyone on the road is safe, and allowing drivers to use cell phones while driving goes against that.

Some people might argue that cell phones can be useful in emergency situations, like if a driver needs to call for help or get directions. But there are ways to handle those situations without using a cell phone while driving. For example, drivers can pull over to a safe place and then make the call or use a hands-free device, like a Bluetooth headset, to talk on the phone while keeping their hands on the wheel.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous and irresponsible behavior that can put not only the driver, but also others at risk. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, and laws should be put in place to prevent this from happening. By being more mindful of our actions and taking steps to stay safe on the road, we can make our communities better and safer for everyone.",1,0
"First , The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in present , because in the text it says "" Numerous factors contriubute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humas to study, despites its proximity to us ""

and another example is that it says "" Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely "" the author supports the idea really well in the story , evidence from the story that supports my claim an introduction is that, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of the imagination and innovation. Inclusion , NASA has a particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray , the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters . Therefore , studying Venus is WORTHY , many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus, electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

"I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. The main reasons for this are twofold. First, the number of people in the world is growing steadily, and as a result, the number of cars needed to transport them is also growing. Second, the technology available to us now allows us to do things with our cars that we couldn't even dream of doing a few decades ago.

One example of how technology is changing the way we use cars is the advent of autonomous vehicles. These cars are capable of driving themselves, and as a result, they are changing the way we commute. Currently, autonomous vehicles are only in use in a few select places, but as they become more common, they are likely to change the way we use cars even more.

Another reason there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is that we are gradually becoming more environmentally friendly. For example, instead of driving our cars to the store, we can now walk or take the bus. This not only saves us time, but it also saves us money.

So, in summary, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, because the world is growing steadily and technology is changing the way we use cars. Additionally, we are becoming more environmentally friendly, which is also contributing to the decrease in the number of cars in use.

"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that can identify human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read our feelings just by looking at our faces! Imagine if teachers could use this technology to know how we're feeling in the classroom. That's what the author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" wants us to think about. But is it a good idea?

I think it's kind of cool that computers can read our emotions now. It's like they can understand us better. But, I'm not sure if it's a good idea for teachers to use this technology in the classroom. Maybe it's an invasion of privacy? Like, what if the computer sees that I'm bored or upset, but I don't want to talk about it? It's not the computer's business how I'm feeling!

On the other hand, maybe it could help teachers understand us better. Like, if they see that a lot of students are stressed or confused, they could change their teaching methods to help us understand better. Or, if they see that we're all bored, they could make the lesson more fun! That would be awesome!

But, what if the computer gets it wrong? Like, what if it thinks I'm mad when I'm actually just concentrating? That could be embarrassing! Or, what if it thinks I'm happy when I'm actually sad? That could be really bad!

I don't know, it's a hard decision. I think it's important to ask the students how they feel about it first. Maybe we could vote on it or something. I don't want to be monitored without my permission, but at the same time, it could be helpful for our teachers to know how we're feeling.

In conclusion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is a complicated issue. While it could be helpful for teachers to understand our emotions better, it's also important to consider our privacy and the potential for mistakes. I think it's important to have a conversation about it and see what everyone thinks before making a decision.",1,0
"The issue of whether a family should tell a cancer patient the truth has been a contentious one in recent years, particularly in the Chinese culture. On the one hand, some people argue that this traditional practice should be changed along with the development of modernization. On the other hand, some people argue that it'should remain the same. In this essay, I will argue that this traditional practice should be changed and that families should tell cancer patients the truth.

First of all, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their treatment, which could lead to poorer outcomes and a worse prognosis. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not seek out the best possible treatment and the cancer may ultimately become more serious. This could have serious implications for the patientâs health and wellbeing.

Secondly, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the emotional support they need to deal with their diagnosis. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to process their emotions and may not be able to access the support they need. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the emotional support they need to cope with the diagnosis and may become overwhelmed by the situation.

Finally, it is important to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they have the best possible quality of life. Without knowing the truth, cancer patients may not be able to make informed decisions about their care and may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life. For example, if a family does not tell a cancer patient the truth and instead tells them that the cancer is not serious, the patient may not be able to access the support they need to ensure the best possible quality of life.

In conclusion, it is important for families to tell cancer patients the truth in order to ensure that they receive the best possible treatment, have the emotional support they need to cope with their diagnosis, and have the best possible quality of life. In the Chinese culture, this traditional practice should be changed to ensure that cancer patients are able to make informed decisions about their care and access the support they need.

Also, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on surface. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography the dense videography ineffective.

"In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyways. Could Miami ever be made a car-free community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Car-free communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to car-free lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient (Rosenthal, Selsky). Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's city-wide car-free day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 (Selsky). A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" (Rosenthal).

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for ... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal). Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear (Duffer). Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more eco-conscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency (Duffer).

Car-free communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though; car-free communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them (Rosenthal, Selsky). Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in city-typical, and definitely Miami-typical, traffic jams (Duffer).

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of car-free lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards car-free communities (Rosenthal). Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or car-pool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues (Rosenthal). Scientists, sociologists, and citizens alike will most likely agree that this move will indubitably be one for the better!",0,1
"I agree partially with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. However, I do not agree that this is the only way. I believe that there are other ways of traveling that are more enjoyable and more efficient. For example, if you are traveling by car, you can take a bus or a train to get to your destination. You can also rent a car and drive it yourself. If you want to go to a place that is very far away, such as a foreign country, it may be better to hire a guide to take you there. A guide can help you plan your trip and make sure you have all the information you need to make the trip as enjoyable as possible. In addition, the guide will be able to point you in the right direction when you get lost or need help finding your way around the city or country.

What is your favorite place to visit and why? I love visiting places that I have never been to before. Places like the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia are all places I would like to see more of. My favorite places are the places where I feel like I can learn something new about the world around me. These places give me a new perspective on life and help me to understand more about myself.

"There is no single answer to the question of whether successful people try new things and take risks. Some people might succeed by sticking to what they know, while others may find success by taking risks and trying new things.

One example of someone who found success by taking risks is Bill Gates. Gates dropped out of college to start Microsoft, a company that would eventually become the worldâs largest software maker. Gates was not afraid to try something new, and his risk paid off.

Another example is Richard Branson, who founded Virgin Records at the age of 22. Branson took a risk by starting a new business in a new industry, and his gamble paid off.

Not everyone is successful by taking risks, of course. Some people might find success by doing what they know well and avoiding risk. But for those who are willing to take a chance, trying new things can be the key to success.

"I think that the electoral college should stay, because the electoral college is a process that with help our country and future problems. most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.

"To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. automobiles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has achieved these and so much more. Their streets are essentially carfree and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance Source 1 Par 6. similarlyyet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a carfree day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaurants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving Source 4 Par 28. these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting automobile usage can do even more.

A limit in automobile usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollutionseeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally automobile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants Source 2 Par 10. France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles Source 2 Par 15. By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.",0,1

"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I agree with this statement for a few reasons. First, many advertisements use models or actors to sell the product. The people in these ads are usually very good looking and have perfect skin, hair, and teeth. They make the products look very appealing. Second, ads often use bright colors and happy music to sell the product. This makes the product look more appealing and makes people want to buy it. Third, ads often use persuasive language to make people want to buy the product. They may use phrases like ""you deserve this"" or ""treat yourself"" to make people feel like they need the product.

While it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, there are some ads that are honest about the product. For example, some ads for acne products show before and after pictures of people who have used the product. These ads are honest about the results of the product and show that it does not work for everyone. There are also some ads that show the negative side of the product. For example, an ad for a new weight loss drug may show the side effects of the drug, such as nausea and vomiting. These ads are more likely to be found in magazines or on the internet than on television.

In conclusion, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is because they use models, bright colors, and persuasive language to sell the product. While there are some honest ads, they are not as common as the ads that make products seem better than they really are.

"I agree with this statemant for three reasons. The first reason is that young people today are too busy with their own lives to give much attention to the world around them. This is especially true for those who live in urban areas where there is a lot of traffic, noise, and pollution. In addition, many of today's youth are not interested in learning about the history and culture of their country or of other countries. For example, in the United States, the average age of a high school graduate is 18 years old. However, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, only about one-third of young Americans have even heard of the Declaration of Independence, which was signed on July 4, 1776, by Thomas Jefferson and other Founding Fathers.

The second reason for this lack of interest in helping others is the fact that many young adults today have no idea what it means to be a good citizen. According to Pew, more than half of Americans (54 percent) believe that the best way to make a difference in this country is to get involved in politics, while only one in four (26 percent), believe it is best to work on improving the country's economy. Young Americans are also less likely than their elders to believe in God (42 percent vs. 56 percent). The third reason why I believe this statement is true is because I have seen it in my own life. When I was a young adult, I worked hard to help my community. I volunteered at a local soup kitchen, worked in a homeless shelter, served meals at an elementary school, helped a senior citizen find a job, volunteered with a church youth group, participated in an after-school program for at-risk youth, attended a summer camp for children with special needs, went on a field trip to see the Statue of Liberty in New York City, visited a veterans' memorial in Washington, D. C., and visited the World War II Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. These are just a few examples of things that I did as a volunteer, but there are many more. As a result of my hard work and my desire to improve the lives of others, my family and I were able to buy our own home and move out of our parents' home in order to start a new chapter in our lives

"This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.",1,0
"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be?",0,1
"Do you agree or disagree that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today? My answer is that I do not believe that there will be many more cars in use in the future. The reason for this is that the number of cars that are used in the U. S. Is declining at an alarming rate. The number of cars in use in the U. S. Was 254,000 in 2009, but it is projected that this number will be lower than 50,000 by 2019. This decline is primarily due to the fact that the number of people in the U. S. Is increasing, and the number of cars that are used to transport these people is not increasing as quickly as the number of cars that are used to transport people.

The reason that the number of cars in use in the U. S. Is declining is also due to the fact that the number of people that are driving cars is increasing. The number of people that are driving cars has increased by 50 percent since the early 2000s. This increase in the number of people that are driving cars is because of the fact that the number of people that are working in the U. S. Has increased as well. The number of people that are working in the U. S. Is increasing because the number of people that are working in jobs that require a car.

In today's fast-paced world, it often feels impossible to stay true to oneself amidst the conflict between personal identity and social expectations. Pressure from the people around us can make it difficult to maintain our sense of self, especially if we feel like conforming to the expectations of the society is our only option. People are driven to become someone else in order to fit in with society, and often find themselves sacrificing their true identity in the process.

This need to conform can have dangerous repercussions. Hiding one's true identity may cause one to become increasingly out of touch with their emotions and the things that truly matter to them. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, âto be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.â Remaining true to oneself, despite the obstacles thrown in our path, shows tremendous courage and resilience.

Throughout history, there have been countless examples of people who have defied societal expectation to remain true to themselves. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Mahatma Gandhi are just a few famous figures who have courageously held onto their identities despite enormous pressure to conform to the status quo. 

It is not easy to stand up against the expectations of society, but by remaining true to oneself one can gain invaluable clarity, peace of mind, and strength. By choosing to embrace one's identity in spite of society's influences, one can remain true to oneself while still connecting with the surrounding world.",1,0

Being an individual is a vital part of having a strong sense of self-confidence and independence. People should not be ashamed of the traits that make them unique; instead, those traits should be embraced. This mindset can be difficult to maintain in a world where there is pressure to conform to group standards. As famed American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once eloquently stated, âTo be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.â It is human nature to seek approval from our peers and loved ones, but it is important to remember that we should strive to live our lives in a way that is true to who we are. 

This endeavor can be a daunting task; it takes courage to be our true selves when faced with the trials and tribulations of life. However, understanding our own values and feelings can ultimately lead to a more meaningful life. If we continue to deny our own thoughts and feelings, we risk letting go of our authenticity and hard-earned independence. As Emerson said, âIt is easy in the world to live after the worldâs opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.â We must not lose sight of our inner voice and remain true to our core beliefs, no matter the consequences.",1,0

"Phones and Driving

Upon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as ""smart phones,"" the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.

Cell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford's Model T, and wouldn't exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody's pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.

The most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.

There is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.

The general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.

The best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.

"Venus, the next planet from Earth and similar in size, seems like a planet we should visit. We haven't gone there because its atmosphere contains sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide and reaches 870 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that any exploratory vessel would have to be acid and heat-resistant, and that's not cheap.

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" says we should study Venus even though it is hard. The author says that Venus is similar to Earth and could have been a place where life existed. The atmosphere could be very dangerous for humans but not for robots. The article also says we could study Venus from a distance using telescopes. We could learn about geology, the atmosphere, and how Venus lost its water. 

I think the author does a great job of supporting their claim that we should explore Venus even though it's difficult. They say it's similar to Earth and we could learn things that would help us on Earth and maybe even find life. They also give ideas on ways to do it without putting humans in danger.

In closing, the author provides excellent reasons to study Venus despite the obstacles. They explain why it's important and how we can do it safely.

"Decreased Driving

In the past, the act of driving was a mandatory ability to possess, but as time progresses, the use of personal cars is declining. The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.

Pollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don't have a large influence on pollution, but ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 5). Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal Paragraph 34). The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" (Duffer Paragraph 10). As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" (Duffer paragraph 14).

In order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 6). Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a close-knit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,"" (Rosenthal paragraph 9).

Not only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,'"" (Selsky paragraph 24).

In addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.

In conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car. These benefits range from improving the condition of the environment thorugh reducing pollution, as well as saving money for those not",0,1

Rosa Parks became an icon of the civil rights movement for her determined stand against racial discrimination. A seamstress from Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. In response to her arrest, members of the African American community in Montgomery initiated a boycott of the cityâs bus system. This boycott helped catalyze national efforts to end racial segregation.

The motivating force behind Rosa Parks's actions was her strong work ethic and enduring commitment to justice. As Thomas Jefferson said, âI like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.â Rosa recognized the potential of a future where everyone was treated equally and she was determined to achieve that vision. âCharacter is like a tree and reputation is like its shadow,â Jefferson said. Rosa's commitment to her beliefs ensured her place in history. Ultimately, Rosa Parks's courageous stand demonstrated the potential of a determined work ethic to bring about positive change.",1,0
"Fact is reality and people have to face the reality no matter how high education you are, reality still can beat you down so easily. If you want to be successful in life, you need to get out of your comfort zone and try new things.

I agree with this statement, but I think it's a bit of a cop-out. I don't think facts are the most important part of education. It's the ability to think critically that is important. You can learn a lot about a subject by reading a book, watching a video, or talking to someone who knows more about the subject than you do. In fact, I would argue that the more you know about something, the better you will be able to explain it to others, and the less likely you'll be to make the same mistakes you made in the first place.

One reason why animals should be treated as resources is because they provide us with a number of benefits. Animals provide us with companionship, helping us to understand the world around us, and providing us with food and clothing. Animals can also provide us with emotional support, which is something that many people need.

Another reason why animals should be treated as resources is because they can provide us with a number of products. For example, animals can provide us with meat, milk, eggs, leather, fur, and other products. These products can be used for food, clothing, and other needs.

"Although the school system has advanced quite far in recent history, there are still plenty of clear problems with the way children receive their education. Many students are constantly stressed out and are not truly learning the material because of it. Additionally, each student may have a different learning style, so it is not helpful to teach them in large groups with the same methods. The recent innovation of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be utilized by schools to vastly improve the way children are educated.

Many issues with the education system could be improved upon, if not completely eradicated, with the use of facial recognition technology within classrooms. As mentioned in paragraph 6 in the article, FACS can be used to recognize when a student is confused. Schools could take advantage of this technology to notify teachers when a student is struggling with material, and help them get back on track. This would allow teachers to adapt their teaching style to best suit each student. Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better.

The potential of this technology is huge, as it could be used to improve every student's life, both inside and outside of school. If schools were to have the ability to help students with any material they don't understand the first time and asist them in coping with or eliminating stress, it would make the experience of going to school much more enjoyable. This would motivate students to do their best to be successful in school, which would drastically improve their life, as well as society in general. If all schools manage to overcome the technical and monetary difficulties of implementing FACS in teaching, it would benefit everybody in many ways.",0,1
"There are a few things that can make a product seem much better than it actually is. One is when the product is made by a company with a good reputation. Another is when the product is a low-cost alternative to a more expensive product. Finally, a product can be advertised as being healthier or more effective than it actually is.

All of these factors can make a product seem much better than it actually is. For example, a product that is made by a company with a good reputation might be advertised as being healthier than it actually is. This is because the company is known for making quality products. Similarly, a product that is a low-cost alternative to a more expensive product might be advertised as being more effective than it actually is. This is because the product is less expensive than the more expensive product.

Finally, a product can be advertised as being more healthy than it actually is. This is because the product is made with healthy ingredients. For example, a product might be advertised as being more effective than it actually is if it is made with natural ingredients. This is because the product is not made with harmful chemicals or toxins.

"Phones and Driving

Phones have negatively affected our people in ways that we have experienced so much pain through the increase in casualty rate. Although phones have had its positive advantages, phone have also had it's disadvantage. Over time the increase in technological devices has caused many distraction in more ways than science can explain. Moreso we see this change and distraction throughout out cars and times of travel. Because of the way we are so emotionally attached to our phones, we forget the importance of many different situations at hand. However, drivers should not be able to operate their technological devices while in a vehicle.

When the discussion is brought upon among the awareness of phones and driving, people get mad. They get frustrated in a manner that they feel the authority, police, and the people are in fact "" doing too much"". The vision that the people don't see is the value of their lives and the correlation between that idea and cellphones in use while operating a vehicle. Studies and different statistics have shown the causes of death from the use of cell phones while driving.

"When people want to make a good choise, they ushally ask for advice. But somethimes they talk to more than one person. This is a good idear because it can help them make a better choise.

First of all, when you talk to only one person, you only get one point of view. That means you don't get to hear other peoples thoughts and ideas. For example, if you want to know if you should get a dog, and you only ask your mom, she might say yes. But if you also ask your dad, he might say no. Then you have to think about both sides and make a decition.

Another reason why seeking mulitple opinions is good is that it can help you find the best solushun. When you talk to different people, they might have different ideas on how to solve a problem. For example, if you want to know how to do better in school, you might ask your teacher, your friend, and your tutor. Your teacher might say do your homework every nite, your friend might say don't worry about it, and your tutor might say practice your math problems. Then you can take all those idears and come up with a plan that works best for you.

Lastly, talking to more than one person can help you not get stuck on one idear. Sometimes when we like something, we can get stuck on it and not think about other options. By talking to different people, you can hear about other options and not get stuck on one thing. For example, if you want to be a baseball player, you might only think about playing in the major leagues. But if you talk to your coach, they might tell you about other leagues you can play in.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is a good idear when you want to make a good choise. It can help you get different point of views, find the best solushun, and not get stuck on one idear. So next time you need advice, don't be afeard to ask more than one person!",1,0
"I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. For example, if you are a doctor, you might try new methods of treatment or procedures that may not be available to your patients or that are less safe. You might also try new ways of caring for yourself or your patients.

Similarly, successful people often take risks when it comes to their businesses. For example, if you are a CEO, you might decide to start a new company or to change your industry. You might also take on new challenges or try new methods of marketing.

There are many reasons why successful people take risks. However, one of the most important reasons is that it can lead to new opportunities. If you are a CEO, for example, you might decide to start a new company because you believe that this is a new and exciting way to serve customers. Similarly, if you are a salesperson, you might take on a new challenge because you think that this is a new way to make sales.

Risks can also lead to new ideas. For example, if you are a scientist, you might decide to study a new topic because you think that this is a new way to understand the world around you. Similarly, if you are a businessperson, you might decide to start a new company because you believe that this is a new way to serve your customers.

The important thing is that successful people take risks not just because this is what they know how to do, but also because they believe that this can lead to new opportunities and new ideas.

"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers think that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. For example, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance on E-dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Write an essay of roughly 300 words.

The overuse of electronic dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. The first disadvantage is that it might lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. When we look up every word we don't know how to spell in the dictionary, we will never learn how to spell them correctly. For example, if we always look up the word ""embarrassment"" in the dictionary, we will never remember how to spell it correctly. The second disadvantage is that it might make us lazy. If we always look up words in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the words from the context. For example, if we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the word from the context. The third disadvantage is that it might make us rely on dictionaries too much. If we always look up words in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the words from the context. For example, if we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will never try to guess the meaning of the word from the context.

There are also some advantages of using electronic dictionaries. The first advantage is that it can help us learn new words. If we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we will learn the meaning of the word. The second advantage is that it can help us check the spelling of the words. If we are not sure about the spelling of a word, we can look it up in the dictionary. The third advantage is that it can help us find the meaning of the words quickly. If we come across a new word ""procrastinate"" in a text, and we look it up in the dictionary, we can find the meaning of the word quickly.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.   ",0,1
"Successful people often have a reputation for taking risks and trying new things. This is because taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success. I agree that successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

Taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success because it allows people to expand their knowledge and skills. For example, if someone is a successful accountant, they may decide to take a course in coding to expand their skillset and open up new career opportunities. By taking this risk, they may find that they enjoy coding and can use it to take their career to the next level. Taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems. For example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to try a new marketing strategy that is outside of their comfort zone. By taking this risk, they may find that the new strategy is more effective than the one they were previously using.

Taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to build confidence. For example, if someone is a successful lawyer, they may decide to take a public speaking course to improve their communication skills. By taking this risk, they may find that they enjoy public speaking and become more confident in their ability to present their ideas. Taking risks and trying new things can also lead to greater success because it allows people to build relationships with new people. For example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to attend a networking event to meet new people and build relationships. By taking this risk, they may find that the connections they make at the event can help them take their business to the next level.

In conclusion, successful people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Taking risks and trying new things can lead to greater success because it allows people to expand their knowledge and skills, think outside the box, build confidence, and build relationships with new people.

"Hi, I'm glad you asked! When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because it can help them make a better choice. Let me tell you why.

First of all, when we talk to only one person, we might not get the full picture. That person might have their own biases or limitations that can affect the advice they give us. For example, if we ask our best friend for advice on what to wear to a party, they might suggest something that looks great on them but not on us. If we talk to multiple people, we can get different perspectives and ideas that we might not have thought of otherwise.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help is that it can give us more information to consider. Let's say we're trying to decide which book to read for our book club. If we ask five people for recommendations, we might get five different suggestions. We can then look at each book's summary, read reviews, and even check out the first chapter to see which one interests us the most. With more information, we can make a more informed decision.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can also help us to avoid confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is when we only listen to people who agree with us, and it can lead to poor decision-making. If we only ask one person for advice, they might tell us what we want to hear instead of what we need to hear. By talking to multiple people, we can get a more balanced view and avoid falling into the trap of only listening to what we want to hear.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help us make a better choice by giving us different perspectives, more information, and avoiding confirmation bias. So, the next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask more than one person!",1,0
"How does technology impact our life in a positive way? Some people argue; that technology is creating a division between us. I believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. If we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. Besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs.

Research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. This is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. It has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. All of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. And they are interacting in certain way with other people. To sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways.

Parents always have many things to do. Passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. Now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. Also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. Although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. In resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents.

In centuries before how many time does a writer spend writing a book? Technology has being a helpful tool for years; long time ago a writer spend one year writing a book by hand, now they just spend 3 to 4 months writing a book in a computer. New technology give us a lot of opportunities like:

We do not work all days, We get a good pay, and We do not work in the sun shy. In resume, technology is facilitate our life.

In conclusion, technology is a wonderful tool that let us develop our communication skills, unify families, and makes easier our jobs. People who does not have skill of listing or talking; they can still communicate their selves. families now are more unify. Jobs now are more easy. I believe technology is having a good effect for those who use it appropiately.",0,1
"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0,1
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",0,1
"""Do not be afraid to ask multiple individuals for advice, sometimes you may need it more than you think."" My mother quoted the words from her elder psychologist frequently during rough periods of time throughout my life. Seeking assistance from others for puzzling situations doesn't mean you're incapable of being independent, it just means you need reassurance that whatever path you take is safe enough to walk through. Not to mention the fact that precisely more than 90% of people who ask for advice usually ends up satisfied with the results. Provided that we bear in mind that geniuses across the globe, whether it be in the past or the present, had to talk to more than one individual for reassurance. Being able to to acknowledge a majority of individuals train of thought about the situation helps ease tension in the mind including the body. Communicating to more than one person about how they would handle the problem increases the chances of making the smartest choice.

That being said, the feeling of dismay and confusion is a distasteful mix, life is a challenge that no one can make out on their own. Seeking multiple opinions from others help you get a better picture of what the right choice to make is. To give an illustration, the main character in the bookÂ ArclightÂ deals with conflict that is too much pressure for her to handle on her own. She seeks help from many others and listens to what they have to say carefully, picking the choice in which favors the most for others. Therefore, she makes the right decision at the end. On condition to that, she not only benefited herself, but as well as for the peers around her. I found this fictional book very astonishing and I definitely learned the importance of not just having myself to rely on, but my friends and the people around me. For this reason is why it's wise to seek others advice and not just think everything through independently.

In many problems, it's essential to focus on the feeling and thoughts on advice. Undoubtedly, there will be times where you disagree with someones opinion, but it's best to understand the way they think about it. Nonetheless, continue to ask for more advice from other peers until you come to the conclusion on what you think is the best option to pick. Always be appreciative on the advice you're given because this opportunity isn't always offered to all, hearing things from another persons perspective is very helpful and it shows that the person cares about what the best choice for you to make is. On condition to that, always ask trustworthy people who you know you can count on before making your own decision. A significant amount of people tend to get anxious when unreasonable and unfair advice is given, so never rely on just one person for reassurance. Furthermore, think critically before you act and not only do you listen to their advice, give them your train of thought on the situation at hand. This leads to both the parties collaborating appropriately with the issue and helping one another get on the same board as one another.

In my final analysis, these are the key reasons on to why I strongly believe that asking multiple individuals for their opinions on what you're quite not sure about is essential. The outcome always has a higher chance of being more reasonable if multiple peers agree with it. That being said, do not be afraid to ask someone for help no matter what the circumstance is at hand. Asking for assistance and receiving opinions help boost your knowledge on how to react and reply to the conflict more professionally and appropriately. Every single individual thinks differently from one another, so it's crucial to acknowledge what advice is given to you and be appreciative about it. Nonetheless, when several opinions are similar to one another there's a higher chance of the advice being the best and the most reasonable choice.",0,1
"I belive motivation is one of the most important qualities that make people successful. If you want to be successful, you have to work hard at it. You can't just sit back and wait for things to happen to you.

I agree with this statement, but I don't think it's the whole story. I think there's a lot more to it than that. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the reason why successful people are so successful is because they're willing to take chances. They're not afraid to try something new and different, even if it doesn't work out the way they want it to. It's not that they have a lack of confidence in their own abilities. Rather, they know that if they take a risk, it will pay off in the long run, and they'll be able to learn from their mistakes and move on to the next thing. This is what I mean when I say ""motivation"" is the key to success. People who aren't motivated are just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again until they get it right the first time. But people who are motivated will take the risk and see what happens. That's why people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, etc. Are all successful in one way or another. Motivation isn't the only thing that makes a successful person, of course. There are other things that go into it as well, such as the ability to think outside the box, to see things from a different perspective, or to have the courage to make a change in your life if you feel that something is not working out as you'd hoped. All of these things go a long way in making a person successful and making them a better person in general.

"Many look up into the sky and see Venus, one of the brightest points in the night sky. While it looks like a star, it is actually a planet. In fact, it is a planet that is extremely difficult to examine closely. According to the author, it is transparent that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers due to the fact that Venus used to be very similar to Earth, the conditions are survivable, and that there are many approaches that can be taken to explore it. The author supports the idea that exploring Venus has immense value well.

Foremost, Venus used to be very similar to Earth. Scientists can research Venus and discover its differences and similarities to Earth. Paragraph four of the article states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may as well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This demonstrates that astronomers are curious about Venus's transformation from a once Earth-like planet to an inhospitable planet. Paragraph four also states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This is crucial because space travel can often take long periods of time. The travel time to Venus will not take nearly as long as other space endeavors.

In addition, Venus's conditions can be survivable to humans. If the expeditions are controlled and cautious, endeavors to Venus are definitely possible. In the article, paragraph five says,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would alllow scientists to float above the fray."" NASA's plan for trips to Venus would be similar to having a spacecraft hovering over Venus's atmosphere. Paragraph five also proclaims, ""air pressure would be close to that of sea level at Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that the journey and process will not be extremely hazardous. The conditions at thirty miles above Venus's atmosphere would be simlar to the condtions on Earth. The dangers are not present at this altitiude and astronomers are still able to collect useful data.

Moreover, there are many other innovative approaches to studying Venus. Paragraph seven states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions."" This displays how researchers can explore Venus's surface without risking human lives. This method is safe and nonhazardous toward humans and is necessary to advance the research of Venus. Paragraph six declares, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough missionto understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are building machines to decrease levels of risk and contribute insightful knowledge to the cause, which makes exploration seem all the more desirable.

Overall, expeditions to Venus are valuable. Gaining statistics about Venus will not only be helpful for scientists analyzing Earth but also with future space missions. Venus is close and similar to Earth. Exploration is survivable and can be safe with the right technology. The author presents these ideas thoroughly and accurately to inform that space travel to Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus, one of the brightest ""stars"" in the sky, will lead travels from Earth beyond doubts and towards innovation.",0,1

Many persons positive and negative attitudes all depends on the difference on there personality. I agree having a positive attitude is the key to success in life, if negative attitudes didnt have a difficult time being happy. I disagree that negative attitude is always hard to be happy with life because sometimes good miracles happen.

If there were more succesful people in the world everybody would be a positive atitude. Most of the people are mixtures of both atitudes. The attitudes affect peoples life so much on which atitude they have.

In conclusion having a positive attitude brings a lot of success in life so, I think more people should have positive vibes. A person who has a negative attitude wont ever enjoy life at its fullest. I agree having a positive attitude is always going to give you better outcomes. Having a negative attitude is difficult to be happy with life.",0,1
"Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the most challenging planets to work on. With its many volcanoes, and its atmosphere full of sulfuric acid, there is nothing safe to this planet. So why do us humans continue to pursue the trip despite the risk? Is it due to the similarity between it and the Earth? Is it really ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents?""

To start off, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, despite being second closest to the sun. This is because Venus contains the most volcanoes out of any planet. The thick atmosphere of Venus is composed of almost ninety seven percent carabon dioxide blankets. Like so, the clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acd, in which adds to the dangers of exploring this planet. On the surface of Venus, temperatures have the capability of averaging over eight hundred degrees Farenheit. To build off of that point, the atmospheric pressure is ninety times greater than what we experience here on Earth. Thus, these conditions are far much more extreme than any human being could handle.

An environment like so has the capability of crushing a submarine that is designed to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean, and along with that the temperatures would liquify many metals. Other factors such as powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes seek probes attempting to reach the surface.

In addition to atmospheric conditions, lets revisit why we even discuss further visits to Venus? Todays astronomers are extremely fascinated by the planet because they believe it was once one of the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. It is prpedicted that in some point in time, Venus was once largely covered in oceans and may have even had the capability of supporting various forms of life, similar to Earth. Venus still has failiar features to Earth, such as a rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and craters.

To continue the idea, how close are we to Venus? Earth is located between its two planetary neighbors, Mars and venus. Lets recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, in which is a crurcial consideration while considering the long time frames in order to pursue space travel. This may seem indisputable to many, however we need to consider, ""what are some other options for pursuing such a risky mission, while creating something in which can be both safe and scientifically productive? NASA has proposed an idea of basically hovering thirty miles above the surface in order to avoid the harsh conditons of the atmosphere. The upside, it would be a moree safe alternative. The downside, Astronauts would be unable to collect samples from the surface of Venus, which brings up a whole new concept of being ""scientifically productive.""

In conclusion, is Venus still worth the pursuit despite the conditions humans can and will face? We still are unsure of a final answer. If we want to further human exploration in space, then it is quite possibly worth the risk. If we are not in nedd of expanding research, then it is not necessary. However, it is quite the given that NASA

would like to expand its knowledge. NASA

continues to work on otherr approaches such as using a heavy duty material in which would last weeks in the conditions. Some equipment used in the past for others sorts of events, doesn't even require electronics at all, which is a major upside to the research of Venus and its aroma. Modern computers would be much to delicate to function in such conditions, and that is why NASA conitnues to pursue research and exploration of Venus. Finally, it is worth it to pursue such a captivating planet despite the intimidating factors. We can now reach a point in which nobody else in the world has reached.",0,1
"Accidents occur more often than we think, especially while driving.

Just think, accidents can happen in the blink of an eye.

There are hundreds of different ways for accidents to occur while driving but I want to focus on texting while driving.

Let's just keep it real, it is difficult to drive and access a phone at the same time, at least that is some multi-tasking skills that no one should try to master.

In this essay, I will be discussing three reasons why texting is not appropriate while driving: distractions, swerving, and all reasons could lead to a potential crash.

Texting while driving becomes an obstruction to other drivers when you are at a stop sign or red light, you are literally watching a phone while others are waiting for you to proceed.

This can lead to people yelling and honking horns just get your attention.

It is just right to respect the fact that there are others on the road, just maybe they want to proceed forth without unnecessary setbacks.

It is safe to try to focus on the road or signs at all times, after all safety should be the main concern for any driver.

Next, there is also the fact that you can easily swerve lanes.

Swerving lanes can be life-threatening.

If you swerve lanes, you can cause several accidents at one time.

I have actually had an experience with something like this.

My mom was texting, when all of a sudden the car began to shift across to the lane, we wound up causing several accidents.

Last but not least, there could be a potential crash.

Obviously, the main reason for not texting while driving is crashing.

I am almost positive that there is some high percentage of crashes caused by text.

I don't have evidence, but it is kind of common sense.

I mean it is difficult to look down at a phone and try to drive at the same time, ""it's an accident waiting to happen"" so to speak.

In conclusion, the real reason not to text and drive is because you can crash and die.

There is no need to sugarcoat the obvious because the end results can end in death.

I try not to text while I am driving because I just started driving and my skills are limited.

I would hate to crash into an innocent person.

"land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",0,1
"Introduction:
Studying Venus seems like a dangerous idea, but is it worth it? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that it is. They say that even though it's hard and dangerous, we can learn important things from Venus that will help us understand Earth and even other planets. But does the author do a good job of showing that it's worth it? In this essay, I'll say why I think they do.

Body:
The author tells us that Venus is like Earth in a lot of ways. It's similar in size and weight, and it's got a thick atmosphere too. But that's where the similarities end. Venus is way hotter than Earth, and the air is full of dangerous gases. The author says that studying Venus can help us learn about Earth's climate and how it could change in the future. They also say that Venus is a good place to test technology for future missions to other planets. This means that what we learn on Venus might help us on other planets too.

The author also tells us that some missions to Venus have already been successful. They mention the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped Venus' surface in the early 1990s. This mission helped us learn more about Venus' geology and gave us some really cool pictures. But even though there have been successes, the author also tells us about the dangers of exploring Venus. They say that the atmosphere is so thick and hot that it destroys most spacecraft that try to land. This means that we have to be really careful and smart if we want to send people to Venus.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author does a good job of showing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They give us good reasons for why it's important to explore Venus, like learning about Earth's climate and testing technology for other planets. They also show us that it's not impossible to explore Venus, even though it's hard. I think that the author makes a strong argument, and I agree that studying Venus is worth it.",1,0
"Venus is often known as the more dangerous 'twin' of Earth. It is located two planets away from the Sun but is hotter than Mercury, the planet next to the sun, even with it being further away. Although Venus is similar to Earth in size and a few other things, thick sheets of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid coat the earth, making it very difficult to research. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents reasons why Venus should be researched, despite the precautions scientists would have to take.

Visiting Venus does not indicate a need to be on the planet's surface. When thinking about being on and researching a planet, individuals would think about what it would be like to be visiting ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (3). A solution made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration claims they could possibly send scientists to Venus but instead of landing, they would ""float above the fray [of Venus]"" (5). This would allow scientists to do some more research on the difficult planet and keeping them safer by only introducing them to ""170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""air pressure [that] would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). NASA is already introducing ideas that are very noteworthy and realistic for more exploration on the planet Venus.

Researchers are building machines and working innovatively to allow more time in Venus for further research. Years ago, rovers and spacecrafts were sent to Venus but ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (2). This information helps conclude how dangerous the planet is and how cautious scientists, researchers, and astronauts would have to be to visit or study more on. In recent years, NASA has worked more on building an electronic device completed with silicon carbide that ""lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" when ""tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface"" (7). This brings another level of excitement for the future of planet exploration because it extends the 'life expectancy' of the spacecraft. Some researchers have also been working on an old mechanical computer technology used in the 1800-1990s. They believe this may be effective on Venus because ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7) rather than more modern technology, which tends to be more fragile. The future of machines that could orbit Venus is worth pursuing for information and it may be a game-changer for all occupations wanting to learn more about the planet itself.

Although there are many valuable reasons as to why Venus is worth studying for, the author includes some evidence that indicate why Venus exploration is not succeeding as well. It is evident that the planet is clearly not accustomed for human settlement. The author reveals to the audience that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3). This explains why a person has not visited and how deathly it would be if someone did. While the author explains how humans can explore even just above the clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, there is also evidence that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). Despite these facts given, the article ends with ""our travels onEarth and beyond should not be limited by dangerous and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8) and this contributes to why visiting Venus is worth it, making all the reasons against visiting less effective because they are not explained as thoroughly throughout.

Even with all the evidence and reasoning behind why the earth is too dangerous to study, the author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit as it is a challenge for the future of space exploration. Scientists and researchers have all the information they need to figure out a plan so they can pursue active studying on the planet Venus. With all precautions aside, Venus is worth spending time on if they can figure out how to do it effectively without too many troubles and hassles.",0,1
"Is it a good idea to let teachers use technology to describe students emotional expressions? To me I say that it is wrong to examine kids emotional expressions because teacher should worry about their ow feelings. They shouldn't be worrying about other students.

Technolgy can be wrong in many ways but this type of technolgy invades students personal space. They feel emotional in lots of different ways because of different reason. The technolgy we use to describe student emotional expressions is smart, but it is wrong to do.

We should not use technology to describe emotional expressions. There is aonther way to describe someones emotional expression by mimicking their facial expressions. All you need to do is try to to make your face look just exactly like your friend then tell what he might be feeling. There are many ways to describe someones emotional expression just by not using technology.

In conclusion, I say that using technology to describe emotional expressions of a students is wrong. It mainly invades their personal space. The technology we use is smart but completely wrong.",0,1
"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.

Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate.

Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality.

In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure.

It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life.",0,1
"There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the individual. Some students may feel that it is more important for them to understand the concepts than to learn the facts. Others may feel that the two are intertwined and that it is more important for them to learn the concepts before learning the facts. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they believe is more important.

One example of this is the issue of climate change. Many students believe that it is more important for them to understand the concept of climate change before they learn the facts about it. They believe that understanding the concept will help them to better understand the facts about climate change and it's effects.

Another example is the issue of gun control. Many students believe that it is more important for them to understand the concept of gun control before they learn the facts about it. They believe that understanding the concept will help them to better understand the facts about gun control and it's effects.

"Phones & Driving

People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.

Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.

Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.

Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.",0,1

Having a positive attitude has been long seen to be a contributing factor in achieving success. Numerous examples abound that demonstrate how individuals have used their optimism and determination to triumph over difficult situations and accomplish their goals.

For instance, Vera Wang began her career as an editor at Vogue, with dreams of designing her own clothing line. Despite the rejections she received, with determination, she landed a job with Ralph Lauren, where she learned the business of design. Eventually, she was able to achieve her dream of launching her own line of luxury clothing that women of all shapes and sizes had access to. This meant challenging the conventional thinking of the industry (Ref 1).

David Letterman has been an example of the positive power that comes from becoming a self-made success. From his early efforts working on radio in early 1970's, Letterman's positive attitude carried him to a long and illustrious career spanning five decades in television as a talk show host and producer. Mr. Letterman attributed his success to âthe desire, energy and luck,â along with âa hell of a good attitudeâ (Ref 2).

Oprah Winfrey is another example of success driven by a positive attitude. In her early years, she overcome poverty, sexual abuse and societal obstacles to become a national television star. Later, as the face of the media brand OWN, Ms. Winfrey used her platform to showcase inspirational stories, teach life lessons and empower her viewers (Ref 3).

In all these examples, it was their positive attitude that allowed them to succeed despite daunting obstacles. With diligence and flexibility, these individuals developed a can-do spirit that attracted people to support them and their dreams.

"Venus, despite its harsh conditions, boasts valuable information that can only be uncovered by exploring it. At least that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" claims. Throughout the article, the author supports and enforces the idea that Venus' exploration involves many challenges, but scarcely explains the benefits of exploring it and consequently why it is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.

The author firsts opens with several facts about Venus to instill a feeling of doubt within the reader. Through this, he leads into the main idea of the article by abruptly asking the question, ""If your sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" After a doubtful introduction, the author provides arguments of the benefits of returning to this hot, dense world. This was a crucial addition to the article that shows his consideration of uninformed readers by first explaining why Venus is so difficult to explore before beginning his first argument of the benefits of exploring Venus.

He promptly answers the question by again giving several facts about the history of Venus. The inherent nature of the first factÂ ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system""Â stirs the reader's curiosity, prompting the author to ask the next question to lead into his following argument. This paragraph serves to hook the reader's by giving relatively surprising facts about Venus that consequently describes the appeal for scientists to study such a planet.

After hooking the reader, the author should go in-depth about how Venus' similarities with Earth make it a valuable target for further research and exploration, but instead, he abruptly begins his next argument about the challenges of exploring Venus. Although the main idea of this article is the difficulties of exploring Venus, the author only addresses the value of exploring it in paragraphs four and eight. The rest of the paragraphs are dedicated to giving possible solutions to the impending goal of exploring the planet; however, he does not follow up on paragraph four's message that does not wholly explain the benefits of exploring Venus. At most, the author makes an argument that Venus is ripe for exploration because of its past similarities with Earth, but he does not explain why. Moreover, he introduces his next argument in paragraph five by making the dogmatic claim that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" in paragraph four.

He nevertheless makes an arguably untenable argument about the dangers and difficulties of exploring Venus, but fails to support the idea that exploring it has value. In the end, the author did well in portraying the challenges involved when attempting to explore Venus, but he did not fully support his claim in paragraph four about the initial benefits of exploring it.",0,1
"According to the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin."" As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.",0,1

"This article is mainly shown to inform readers just how useful exploring Venus can be. The author is quite enthusiastic about this topic and is eager to offer his/her insight on the subject. The author believes that getting a chance to explore Venus is a great benefit, because previous studies have led to scientists speculating that Venus was probably at one point in time just like Earth. Meaning that it probably was suitable for life or once had life, however it is unlike;y that it has any forms of life now.

Venus has too harsh of conditions to be able to support anything. High atmoshperic pressure, High concentration of sulfuric acid in the air, Intense heat all of these factors go into reasoning as to why it is not a good idea to go there unprepared especially when NASA is still working on ways to do so, or maybe they have ( I don't know i haven,t been updated on a topic) anyway even though it is proven to be dangerous it is not impossible. Landing on Venus and gathering data would be an outstanding accomplishment.

The author clearly wants this to happen and is very interested to see what else the world can achieve. Showing great interest on the topic and overall writing this article in general.",0,1
"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea.                                    ",0,1
"Dear Senator,

This is a fabulous and very plentiful country. We the people are grateful of our freedom and love our leaders. However, our system of choosing our leaders is not the best. The Electoral College is unreliable and not very accurate. We should vote by most popular choice among the citizens of America.

The electoral voting system is not very efficient because, mostly by this in my opinion, each state really has only 1 vote. A represenative worth 55 million people should not be equal to a represenative worth only 500,000 people. This system is very unbalanced and unfair to the American people. Canidates for the election only have to focus on certain states that they can swing in their favor and get most of the states votes, but they won't always be getting most of the peoples votes.

An election where each citizen counts as 1 vote and out of all those votes the majority wins. That is a more than fair system of voting, not some system where we vote for someone to vote for us. That's just flat out unethical, unfair, and unwanted.",0,1

Some people think that the animals should be treated as pets because they are cute, and they can be played with and taken for walks. Others think that animals are resources of food and clothing, and that they should not be treated as if they are just animals.

I think that animals should be treated as if they are resources of food and clothing. Animals are valuable resources, and they should not be treated as if they are just animals. Animals are capable of so much, and they should not be taken for granted. They should be treated with respect, and they should not be treated as if they are just things to be used and abused.

"The world is changing rapidly, and the way we get around is no exception. In the past two decades, we have seen a dramatic shift in the way we travel, with the rise of ride-sharing services, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars. With these changes, it is reasonable to assume that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

The most obvious reason for this is the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft. These services allow people to get around without having to own a car, and they are becoming increasingly popular. In the US alone, the number of ride-sharing trips has increased by more than 400% since 2014. This trend is likely to continue in the coming years, leading to fewer cars on the road.

Another factor that will contribute to fewer cars in use is the rise of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, and they are becoming more affordable. This means that more people are likely to switch to electric vehicles in the coming years, leading to fewer cars powered by gasoline. Additionally, electric vehicles are more efficient than gasoline-powered cars, meaning that fewer cars will be needed to meet the same level of demand.

Finally, autonomous cars are likely to become more common in the next twenty years. Autonomous cars are cars that can drive themselves, and they are becoming increasingly advanced. This means that fewer cars will be needed to meet the same level of demand, as one autonomous car can do the job of multiple human-driven cars.

In conclusion, it is likely that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is due to the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services, the rise of electric vehicles, and the development of autonomous cars. All of these factors will lead to fewer cars on the road, and a more efficient transportation system.

"In the past two decades, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cars on the road. In the United States alone, the number of cars has doubled from 120 million to 240 million. In China, the number of cars has quadrupled from 10 million to 40 million. India has seen a tenfold increase, from 2 million to 20 million.

With the advent of self-driving cars, electric cars, and ride-sharing services, we are likely to see a decrease in the number of cars on the road in the next 20 years. Self-driving cars will become more common, as the technology continues to improve. Electric cars will become more prevalent, as battery technology improves and the costs of electric cars come down. Ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, will become more popular, as they offer a more convenient and affordable alternative to owning a car.

In 20 years, we will likely see a significant reduction in the number of cars on the road. This will have a positive impact on the environment, as there will be fewer emissions from cars. It will also reduce congestion on the roads and make it easier for people to get around.

"Whether if it's a law in a country, the source of pollution or the cause of deaths, the usage of cars have its disadvantages and have been limited. However, driving cars have its advantages when individuals limit the use of it.

Using cars to reach a destination causes pollution according to experts, who are correct. According to paragraph 5, ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipe...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Because of this there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities safer and easier to breathe in. A city that faces these pollution problems is Paris, which made authorities to prohibit driving. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This is the right thing to do because after this law was implemented there was less congestion. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" Pollution also has more of an impact depending on the temperature and day. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions."" Also there are cities where using cars are near impossible, because of the laws that the governmental officials had enforced. An example of a city with these laws is Vauban, Germany. ""Street Parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. vaughn's streets are completely carfree.""' However, There are advantages when individuals drive less. Owners of the public transportation have taken action. They subliminally convinced drivers to reduce pollution and dangerous accidental by offering free transportation. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday."" When this was taken into action, smog was cleared in cities. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" When individuals drive less they are exposed to new activities that they have never experienced when driving. People can experience activities in places such as in Bogota, Colombia. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" The main goal for this was to advocate other transportation in order to reduce pollution. There are also other factors that can substitute the place of driving. A suggestion was made by Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of the University's Policy center and Mobilities Research. She said that ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Also that ""the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared services for getting to work."" Bill Ford, who is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has also suggested factors for safety and transportation. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'"" Using cars for transporation is mostly a problem, even if authorities have enforced a law for it, if it causes pollution or even danger in cities. But, it can only be a good thing if individuals are limiting the usage of it.",0,1
"There are many things that people enjoy about life, and age is just one factor that determines what those things are. While itâs true that some young people enjoy life more than older people do, there are many exceptions to this rule.

One reason why some young people enjoy life more than older people do is because they have more energy. They can stay up late and party all night, and they can still function the next day. They donât have to worry about getting enough sleep or taking care of their health.

Another reason why some young people enjoy life more than older people do is because they donât have as many responsibilities. They donât have to work, they donât have to take care of a family, and they donât have to worry about bills. They can just enjoy their youth and not worry about the future.

However, there are also many older people who enjoy life more than young people do. One reason for this is that they have more money. They can afford to travel, to buy nice things, and to eat at nicer restaurants. They donât have to worry about where their next meal is coming from or how theyâre going to pay their rent.

Another reason why some older people enjoy life more than young people do is because theyâve already accomplished a lot. Theyâve established their careers, theyâve raised their families, and theyâve made a difference in the world. They can look back on their lives and be proud of what theyâve accomplished.

In conclusion, there are many factors that determine whether someone enjoys life more than another person does. Age is just one of those factors.

"Are you a successful person? Or do you want to be a successful person? If you are a successful person, you certainly have a positive attitude in your life. If you want to be a successful person, you also need a positive attitude to solve the problem that happen in your life, or to people around you like family or even a stranger. Do you want to know why the positive attitude is so heavy in value for a successful person? First of all, the positive attitude will be a manager of your mood. Second, you need a positive attitude to look everything in a positive way. Third, the way that people decide to respect you is through your manner. Finally, positive attitude can bring a marvelous gift to your life if you are become a chief of positive manner, such as a successful person.

To be more specific about how importance of attitude, your day is great or bad is depended on how your attitude toward the happen. For example, you dressed a beautiful shirt in the pretty day, suddenly, somebody walked pass you and spilled coffee on your shirt. Which attitude should you make to let your day continuing to be a great day? You get angry and ruin everything, or you give a bright smile and make a nice conversation. Your positive attitude definitely gives you an energy to show your enthusiasm in daily activities. A short fact in Generic_School, students enjoy to go to the library before the class starts, because there is a big welcome from those librarians. They always smile, explain or help you when you need. A simply good morning with a pretty can make you feel today is going to be a great day, then you may pass their great attitude to someone else that you do not even know. Life is stressful, but your positive attitude will change stressful life to a sweet life.

In addition, you want everything in your life go smoothly, you need a perfect attitude for yourself to looking for a fitting path. People may be loose their sight in the darkness, just because they do not use the right manner to treat things that happen around them. They are upset, when they cannot get the result expectantly, loose their enthusiasm, and give up their wants. The following story of two little girl will support that the positive attitude heal your failing on something and return back a chance to make your life success. Generic_Name and Generic_Name have been friend since they were five-year. At the age of sixteen, both girls had a same hobby of shoe collecting, and they always shared with each other. However, one day in the afternoon, Generic_Name came back from school and she planned to wear the sparkle pink sandal to the store, but she found out it was lost. Immediately, she was thinking of Generic_Name stole her shoe, because of those words Generic_Name said yesterday that Generic_Name wanted the same shoe Generic_Name had but her mom did not let her to buy. After that, Generic_Name and Generic_Name had a worst conversation that they have never ever had; they gave up on their friendship for along time until Generic_Name discovered her shoe was hidden in the dark conner of a drawer. Instead of ignoring Generic_Name, Generic_Name was looking for the way to explain to regain their friendship. Generic_Name assumed, you can realize that the negative attitude will destroy what you appreciate, then the positive manner heals your mistake and gives you a success after.

Last, the correct or positive attitude can value your personality, so that affects the way people look at you. You must not expect people judge you that you are a great person or you are successful. People estimate you through your manner toward to future or what you had done in the past.

One effective strategy for remembering to pass the ball in soccer is to focus on your teammates, both while playing the ball and when you donât have it. During games, be aware of potential passing options from the moment the ball is kicked. This will help you make the right decision quickly and not miss out on chances to connect with teammates. Additionally, try verbalizing the pass you plan on making before you make it. This will help you develop a sense of mental discipline which, in the heat of the game, will help you decide when the best time to pass the ball is. Finally, itâs important to practice passing drills in training and games, as this will help you build muscle memory and help you know when and how to pass the ball. With practice and dedication, these strategies can help you remember to pass the ball during games.",1,0
"Every afternoon hundreds of thousands of youths flood Internet cafes, switch on a game console, or otherwise sit down to involve themselves in intense fantasy words. Some of them play games for hours on end, while others play them for only a few minutes at a time. What do you think? Do you agree with the statement that ""playing video games is bad for children""? If you answered ""yes"", then you are not alone. In fact, the majority of people in the United States believe that video game playing is harmful to children, according to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The survey, which was conducted in June and July of this year, asked a representative sample of 1,002 adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia about their views on the effects of video gaming on young people. Of the respondents, 63% said that playing video or computer game is ""bad for kids."" The percentage of respondents who agreed with this statement was higher among men (69%) than among women (57%). The majority (56%) of those who said video and computer gaming was harmful also said it was ""very"" or ""somewhat"" harmful, compared with 39% of the people who did not believe this to be the case.

The survey also asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with a number of other statements, including the following: ""Video games can be fun, but they can also be a distraction from real-life problems""; ""I think it's important for parents to talk to their children about the dangers of playing games""; and ""Parents should teach children how to control their use of computers and other electronic devices."" In response to the last question, a plurality (44%) agreed that parents should ""teach children to use their devices responsibly,"" while a third (33%) said they should not. When it came to teaching children not to play computer and game games, however, more people agreed than disagreed (45% vs. 33%).

"Vehicles were invented to help people move around. The first cars were simple and easy to use, and they helped people get around without having to walk. In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

Some people may argue that this is a good thing, because it will make it easier for people to get around. Others may disagree, because they may find it hard to find a place to park their car. Either way, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years.

The drawback to this is that cars will become less useful. They will no longer be able to get around easily, or they may not be able to do so at all. This will make it harder for people to get around, and it could even lead to accidents.

Overall, it is clear that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. This may not be a bad thing, but it is important to be aware of the potential consequences.

For example, if someone is going through trouble like, a death in their family they might reach out to someone close they trust like a friend or a very close family member on their of how they should deal with pain they are experiencing.

There are also many people who's opinion could be very help. Like the counselors at your school or just one of parents or guardians. some times multiple opinions could be very important in a situation like a political debate or a simple argument to prove a point. Multiple opinions could also help make choose the answer to difficult situations we cannot figure out on our own.

For example, difficult situations like searching for jobs, filling out a job application. but more importantly they help with conflicts to. Like fights at school for instance.

"Bycicles. Walking. Public buses.Â  All three are alternatives to driving a car to arrive at places that you need to go.Â  Some believe that having an automobile is essential to everyday life.Â  Others may say that cars are unnecessary and a pollutant in our society.Â  There are many advantages of limited car usage.

Limiting the use of cars could help reduce the amount of pollutants in our environment.Â  In Source two, it states, ""Cold nights and warm air caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission.""Â  This tells us that car emissions are being caught in the air due to the weather, causing a layer of smog to settle over congested cities.Â  By limiting the use of automobiles, the layer of smog was able to vanish, but if we were able to limit cars permanently, then we would not have to worry about it in the first place.Â  In Source four, it tells us that, ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions.""Â  This proves that car emissions are harmful to the environment and that future generations are at risk because of the pollution already in the air.Â  Also, the statement shows that Americans are very dependant on transportation, but are unwilling to try a different method such as walking and biking.Â  By reducing the number of cars on the road, our environment would be helped tremendously.

Having to worry about driving a car may produce more stress in a persons life.Â  In Source three, it says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""Â  This tells us that riding in an automobile, while the roads are very crowded, causes people to worry about whether or not they are going to be in an accident.Â  Also, it has been proven that exercise helps to lower stress, and by riding a bike instead of driving a car, stress may be lowered by simply using your resources to get where you need to go.Â  In Source one, it tells us, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now. (Heidrun Walter, mother of two).""Â  This proves that people are worried about their car and if it might break down, or something worse.Â  Something can always go wrong with a car, whether it be trouble with the engine or you accidently locked your keys inside, and it becomes very expensive when you have to fix a small blunder.Â  By limiting car ownership, less people have to worry about their automobile.

A great alternative to owning a car is public transportation.Â  In Source four it explains, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.""Â  By uses others means of tranportation, it makes it very convenient for kids to meet up with their friends for a while, and still get to where they need to go.Â  Also, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car and gas for it, and it helps reduce the number of cars on the road.Â  In Source two, it tells us that ""Public transit was free of charge for Friday to Monday.""Â  By taking the bus that the government provided people received free transportation, allowing them to not have to worry about parking, gas prices, or potential accidents.Â  They could travel wherever they needed to go on a very convinient mode of transportation for no cost to them.Â  Public transportation, or car-pooling, is an amazing way to lower the number of cars on the road, while still providing people with a way to be driven to the destination they need to get to.

Automobiles, the plugs to the sinks of the streets of the world, seem to clog up the efficient system of transportion.Â  Parents, workers, and athletic kids alike are affected by the large number of cars on the road.Â  By reducing the number of cars on the road, there would be a direct impact on our environment, emotions, and future generations.",0,1
"One summer afternoon, a boy named Generic_Name asked his mom if he could go to the park. She agreed, but told him not to stay out too late. Generic_Name informed his dad about going out and he said to travel with a few of his friends, due to kidnappings in the area he didn't want Generic_Name to be alone at the park. Generic_Name also told his older brother about him leaving the house for a bit and he said to watch the area for anything suspicious and that if he did see something, that Generic_Name and his friends should head home immediately. Thanks to his family, Generic_Name and his friends got home safe and sound. Listening to multiple opinions can help people make safer and smarter decisions.

The first example is that multiple opinions can help you make safer choices. Like with Generic_Name, going out with people you know is a great way to stay safe. Doing things in broad daylight helps as well. Unfortunately many kidnappings and random shootings are happening presently. Following all of this advice could help a simple walk to the corner store just that much safer.

Secondly, taking in multiple opinions help people make smarter decisions too. Referring back to the introduction when Generic_Name's brother told him to survey the area and watch for any strange activity was anÂ amazing idea. Watching for people that are acting out of the ordinary is a helpful tip, because if that person were to do something weird knowing who exactly it is your getting away from is a good thing. You also always want to know where you are at all times. It's also important to know where every exit and entrance available in any public setting.

In summary, listening to the advice of multiple people is a way to stay safe and make educated decisions. If Generic_Name were to just leave the house without speaking to his dad or brother, who knows what could have happened. The safety of you and your peers is a major priority. Everyone should get a second opinion on as many things as possible.",0,1
"The world of competitive gaming is an ever-evolving landscape that has seen a massive surge in popularity and interest in the past decade. Various types of tournaments, events, and leagues have begun to be organized around some of the most popular competitive games available today such as Fortnite, Call Of Duty Warzone, League Of Legends and Dota 2. This essay will focus specifically on the rise in popularity of mobile esports - a form of videogaming where players compete against each other using their smartphones or other handheld devices. Mobile esports can be traced back to 2010 when gamemakers started developing titles for smart phones with more complex graphics than those previously used on smaller feature phones. As technology advances allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences on mobile platforms, it opened up new opportunities for players who were looking to engage in intense competition outside of traditional consoles or PCâs. With the introduction of 4G networks which brought higher bandwidth speeds and better latency controls over wireless networks; combined with ever increasing power & graphical capabilities embedded within device hardware; these factors helped propel smartphone gaming into being taken seriously as an exciting platform for tournament play & spectator sport alike. What took things further was when big names like Epic Games developed hit games like âFortniteâ where users could easily join their friends online from anywhere via their mobile devices â creating huge communities that joined together from all corners of the globe â this was what really kicked off Mobile Esports into a whole new level! These days there are literally thousands upon thousands professional gamers making money playing & streaming live games through apps like TwitchTV & YouTube Gaming Channel etc. Events now span multiple countries across Asia Pacific Region (APAC) with World Championships taking place every year offering millions in cash prizes! Traditional sports teams are even getting involved too by sponsoring Mobile Esports teams â just recently Manchester City Football Club announced they had acquired Fnatic Rising (a London based team dedicated exclusively towards Mobile Esports). .

But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.

Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person. The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.

The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (6). By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education.

"Successful people often take risks and try new things in order to reach their goals. While it is true that they may already have skills and knowledge that they can rely on, they also recognize that they need to push themselves in order to continue to grow and reach new heights. I believe that successful people understand that taking risks and trying new things is essential for growth, and I agree that this is a key factor in their success.

To begin with, successful people understand that their skills and knowledge may not be enough for them to reach their goals. They want to reach the highest levels, and they recognize that this requires them to be willing to take risks and try new things. For example, a successful entrepreneur may have already achieved success in one area, but they may want to expand into a new industry. In order to do this, they need to be willing to take a risk and try something new. They may need to learn different skills, or they may need to reach out to new people and networks. Without taking this risk, they may never have achieved the success they are now enjoying.

In addition, successful people recognize that taking risks and trying new things can open up new opportunities. For instance, a successful businessperson may decide to take a risk and enter a new market. While this may seem like a risky decision, it could also open up new opportunities for growth and success. By taking this risk, they may be able to expand their business and reach new customers. Similarly, a successful artist may decide to try a new style or medium, which could lead to new opportunities and recognition.

Finally, successful people understand that taking risks and trying new things can help them to stay motivated and inspired.

For example, a successful entrepreneur may decide to try a new business venture, which could help them to stay motivated and inspired. Similarly, a successful artist may decide to explore a new medium, which could help them to stay creative and inspired.

In conclusion, successful people understand the importance of taking risks and trying new things in order to reach their goals. They recognize that their skills and knowledge may not be enough, and they need to be willing to take risks and try new things in order to open up new opportunities and stay motivated and inspired. I believe that this is a key factor in their success, and I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

"Dear State Senator,

I'm writting to you today to tell you that we should keep the Electoral College. I know some people say it's unfair but I think it's good. First, it makes sure that the president has to win support from lots of places, not just the biggest cities. If we had popular vote, the president would just have to worry about the big cities and ignore the smaller places. This way, they have to care about everyone.

Another thing is that the Electoral College makes sure that the president has to get support from different groups of people. Like, if a candidate is really popular with one group, they might not be popular with another. The Electoral College makes sure they have to find a way to get support from both groups. It helps them to be more fair.

Also, the Electoral College is in the Constitution! It's been there since the beginning, so it must be important. If we change it now, it would be like we're saying the founding fathers were wrong. They must have put it in there for a reason.

I know some people say that it's not fair because sometimes the person who wins the popular vote doesn't win the election. But that's not always true! Sometimes the person who wins the popular vote does win the election. It's not like it never happens. And besides, like I said before, the Electoral College makes sure the president has to worry about everyone, not just the people who voted for them.

So, I think we should keep the Electoral College. It's a good system that helps make sure the president is fair to everyone.

"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject for several reasons. First, having a broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives. For example, a person who specializes in history may only see the world through the lens of history, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may see the world through the lens of history, math, science, and so on. This broader perspective can help people make better decisions and understand the world around them better.

Second, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more creative. For example, a person who specializes in history may only be able to think of history-related ideas, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to come up with history-related ideas, math-related ideas, science-related ideas, and so on. This broader creativity can help people come up with new solutions to problems and be more innovative.

Third, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more well-rounded. For example, a person who specializes in history may only know a lot about history, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may know a lot about history, math, science, and so on. This broader knowledge can help people communicate with others more effectively and understand different points of view.

Fourth, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help people be more successful in their careers. For example, a person who specializes in history may only be able to find a job as a history teacher, while a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to find a job as a history teacher, a math teacher, a science teacher, and so on. This broader knowledge can help people be more versatile and adaptable in the workforce.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives, be more creative, be more well-rounded, and be more successful in their careers.

"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

"Picture a movie. Now, picture a conflict, and then a mad dash to the airport to declare love or patch things up between the protagonist and a prospective soulmate. In the end, the problem is solved, and the two people have found each other despite all odds. The outcome is picturesque, perfection tied up with a bow. However, it wasn't always this way. Something has to happen for the protagonist to finally hop into a taxi and speed off into the sunset. That something almost always takes place after the main character is overwhelmed with something they cannot control, something they find too hard to handle on their own. That something is advice. The value of advice to the protagonist is surely immeasurable, as it shows that someone cares, and provides them with a plethora of separate ways to look at the issue. Advice is vital to a person's grasp of a situation, and the positive effects of good advice are priceless.

We as human beings crave empathy. If it is lacking from a person's life, chances are they will be drawn to any hint of it from somebody else. Advice is a common form of empathy, as it is made up of an understanding of a certain situation and sympathy towards the problems it is causing a person. It displays a level of awareness that isn't found in other contexts. Being able to listen to advice from more than one person helps regardless of what is being said, because it reassures a person that they are not alone in dealing with their problem.

Even though advice is generally recieved from trusted individuals, it is important to be careful. When it comes from someone whose intentions are to help solve the issue, it can have a positive effect on the reciever. If it is doled out by someone whose sole intention is to benefit themselves, it can harm everyone involved. In order to avoid the latter, it is exceedingly important to rely on not just one person's opinion, but a wide variety of solutions to the problem. That way, instead of risking your emotions and livelihood on a single, possibly prejudiced opinion, you can analyze an array of opinions to find the ones that help you the most.

A month ago, I found out I was moving to another county. This meant that I would be away from the high school that I had applied to, and that because of the distance I wouldn't be able to see my friends again. It seemed like there was no successful end in sight, and that I had tried every possible solution with no outcome. I went to see a therapist to talk about this issue, and to seek some reassurance that I would be all right no matter where I went. Listening to one person, however, didn't help me feel any better. In the end, what helped was talking it through with my friends and listening to each and every one of their opinions on the matter. I didn't feel alone, as though I was the only one who cared about how this was affecting me, and I was able to look at the situation with fresh eyes. I was faced with solutions I hadn't even considered, because they were coming from people who could empathize with me in a different way. When it came to how to handle this difficult experience, I could make a choice based on not just my own thoughts, but the thoughts of those around me.",0,1

According to the League of American Bicyclists, cycling is now the most popular form of transportation in many U. S. Cities, and it is also growing in popularity around the world. In fact, the number of cyclists on the road has increased by 50% in the past decade. This is likely due to the increasing popularity of cycling as a way to improve health, reduce pollution, and save money.

Another reason why the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years is because of the increasing cost of car ownership. The cost of car ownership has been on the rise for a number of reasons, including the increased cost of fuel, the increased cost of repairs, and the increased cost of parking. In addition, the cost of car ownership has been increasing faster than the rate of inflation, which has made it more difficult for people to afford cars.

Overall, I believe that the number of cars in use will decrease in the next twenty years, due to the increasing popularity of alternative transportation methods, the increasing cost of car ownership, and the increasing cost of fuel.

"In the United States, democracy is advertised as a method of acheiving selections, though this is unfortunantly not the case. In the United States, we, as individuals, are not permitted to a ""fair"" or equal opportunity of voting systems. Vote should be popular, the will of the people of the nation, though through the Electoral College, the people is denied.

Voting is, as far as common sense goes, the majority rule. The Electoral College voting system was established during the creation of the Constitution in order to secure a ""qualified vote""- an effort to diminish the will of the lesser, or unknowing. Arguably, it is stated that, ""..the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", or in other words the statement can easily be translated to ""we do not wish a nation of idiotic voters to decide our president"", each individual of the nation is mindful of others and care enough to express their opinion, as it is known a is a citizens duty to vote. A duty that must be followed. In any effort to simplify this, a voter is a voter. They are all ""qualified"". If a person cares enough about their nation to cast a ballot, without requirment, they certainly are qualified.

Now that the qualifications are established, the electors within the Electoral College are free to do as they wish. Waving a magic wand, the support of others is unimportant now, and they pull whatever they desire out of the hat, as written by Bradford Plumer, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsiblefor picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". What happened to majority rule? People should have the direct vote of presidential candidate, however we are faced with shocking facts such as the house selection rarely dispalying the correct majority rule, ""The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"".

The dispicable system was established long ago for an extremely specific purpose with specific issues, which is no longer the case today. In the United States, we are not a democracy. We are a Republic. Ridiculusly, voters do not control the election in our Republic, as shared,""...over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election"". Can those expect change? Ironically, no. The system would most like not allow that, and those mindful citizens would need to hope for a glance at serendipity.",0,1
"I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because the technology has advanced so much. For example, I believe that we will be able to use self-driving cars and trucks, which will make travelling around in them much easier. This will also reduce the need for people to take public transport, as the cars will be able to do all the work for you.

There are other reasons too. For example, we now use more petrol and diesel than we ever have before. This means that there are more cars that need to be serviced and repaired, which takes time and money. Plus, it means that the number of cars on the road is constantly increasing, which means that it is harder and harder for people to get around without having to take to the road.

So in conclusion, I believe that in twenty years, fewer cars will be in use than now because the technology has advanced so much. This will make travelling around in them much easier and reduce the need for people to take public transport.

"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book,

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

"I think this would be helpful to use this technology to read students.

I agree on using this type of technology because you could tell how people and students are feeling. This is also helpful because it would be easier for teacher to help you out when your confused and having trouble with things when some students are to shy to ask for help. These classifieds 6 basic emotions of people like disgusted, happy, sad, fearful, angry, and surprise. Computers can even know if your happy or sad, some people don't really talk and mostly spend time on their computer so also for the computer to know if their happy or sad is helpful.

Finally this is helpful because people could be going through a hard time or has something that you don't know and you could even be helpful on telling them to talking it out and giving advices to them. This would make them fell better than usually.",0,1
