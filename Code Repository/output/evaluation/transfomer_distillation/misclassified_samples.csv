"I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. It's really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving. I know some people might say that it's important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving, but it's just not worth the risk.

First of all, using a cell phone while driving takes away from the driver's attention on the road. When you're driving, your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel. But when you're on your phone, you're not paying attention to what's happening around you. You might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street. It's just too dangerous.

Another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction. When you're texting or scrolling through social media, you're not focused on driving. You might be looking at your phone instead of the road, and that's when accidents happen. It's like driving blindfolded.

Also, think about how fast you're going when you're driving. You could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster. That means that if you're distracted by your phone, you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it. You could be missing red lights, stop signs, and other important signs on the road.

Furthermore, a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving. They know how dangerous it is, and they don't want people to die or get hurt. If it's illegal, it must be bad.

I know some people might say that they need to be able to use their phone for work or emergencies. But there are ways around that. You could use a hands-free device or have a passenger answer the phone for you. Or you could just pull over to a safe place and then answer the phone. It's not that hard.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed. It's a major distraction and takes away from the driver's attention on the road. It's also illegal in a lot of places, and there are ways to avoid having to use your phone while driving. Drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone.",1,0
"Hey, I know that some people believe that the Face on Mars is proof that aliens visited our planet, but let's get real here. There's no way that some aliens carved a giant face into the side of a mountain on Mars. I mean, think about it. If they had the technology to travel all the way to Mars and build a face, don't you think they would have left behind more evidence than just a weird mountain?

Plus, the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" explains that the Face is just a natural landform that was created by geological processes. The author, a scientist named Alfred McEwen, says that the Face is actually a mesa, which is like a flat-topped mountain, and that it was formed by erosion and weathering over millions of years. He even has pictures that show how the Face has changed over time, which proves that it's been there for a long time and wasn't just suddenly built by aliens.

I know some people might say that the Face looks too perfect to be natural, but that's just not true. McEwen explains that the Face is actually a pretty common landform in the Martian terrain, and that it's not unusual for mesas to have flat, smooth surfaces. He even compares it to other mesas on Mars that have similar features.

Also, the article talks about how the Face was discovered in 1976 by a NASA spacecraft, and how scientists have been studying it ever since. If aliens had built the Face, don't you think they would have said something about it by now? It's been almost 50 years since it was discovered, and there's still no sign of any alien life on Mars.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is not some supernatural alien creation. It's just a natural landform that was formed by geological processes over millions of years. There's no evidence to support the idea that aliens built it, and plenty of evidence to support the idea that it's just a regular old mesa. Let's be real, people. It's time to stop believing in fairy tales and start trusting the science.",1,0
"Hey fellow citizes,

We got a big problem on our hands. Cars. They're everywhere. And they're ruining our planet. We gotta limit car usage or else we'll be in big trouble.

First off, cars are a major source of air pollution. They release harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, transportation is responsible for 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. That's a huge chunk! And cars are the main culprit.

But it's not just the air pollution that's the problem. Cars are also a major source of traffic congestion. Have you ever sat in traffic, stuck in your car for hours, wondering why you even bothered leaving the house? It's a huge waste of time and it's causing us all a lot of stress. In fact, according to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average commuter in the US spends 42 hours per year stuck in traffic. That's like, a whole extra work week!

And let's not forget about the accidents. Cars are involved in a lot of accidents, and they can be deadly. In 2019, there were over 36,000 fatal car crashes in the US alone. That's a lot of lives lost, and it's a huge burden on our healthcare system.

So what can we do about it? We need to limit car usage. We can start by investing in public transportation. Buses and trains are way more efficient than cars, and they produce a lot less pollution. We can also encourage people to carpool, bike, or walk to work. And we can make sure that our cities are designed in a way that promotes walkability and bikeability.

But it's not just about the environment. Limiting car usage can also save us money. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average American household spends over $8,000 per year on transportation. That's a lot of cash! If we can reduce our reliance on cars, we can save money on gas, maintenance, and parking.

In conclusion, cars are a big problem. They're polluting our air, causing traffic congestion, and getting into accidents. We need to limit car usage and invest in alternative modes of transportation. It's good for the environment, our health, and our wallets. So let's all do our part and try to use our cars a little less. We can make a difference, one car at a time.

"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.

Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.

However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.

Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     ",0,1
"Dear Fellow Citzens,

We all know that cars are a big part of our lives. They get us places fast and make our lifes alot easier. But have you ever thought about how cars are effecting the earth? There are alot of bad things that come from cars. They polute the air and make it harder to breathe. They use alot of gas which comes from fossil fuels which are running out. And they kill alot of people. Like, thousands of people die in car accidents every year. It's crazy.

We should limit car usage for a bunch of reasons. First off, it'll help the earth. If we all drove less, there would be less polution in the air. Plus, we wouldnt use as much gas and that means we wouldnt be using up all the fossil fuels so fast. And it would be safer. There would be fewer cars on the road, so there would be fewer accidents. It's a win-win.

Also, it would be good for our health. Walking and biking are great ways to exersise. If we did those things more, we would be alot healthier. And it would be good for the econimy too. If we all walked and biked more, we wouldnt have to pay so much for gas and car maintance. Think about it.

There are allready alot of ways we can limit car usage. We can carpool, use public transportation, and bike or walk when it's possible. Some cities even have bike lanes and stuff. We just need to start doing it more.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great way to help the earth and our health. It's good for the econimy too. We should all try to drive less and use other ways to get places.

"Yes, I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For example, a product say a shampoo or some beauty product is advertised in an extra-ordinary manner with a beautiful woman, a serene background, a great and pompous music and captivating puchlines and narration. But, in reality I don't think the product would be so great. It would be like any other beauty product that we may be using with slight differences in colour, odour and ofcourse, the price. Most companies advertise their products in this manner because, they have to compete with other companies which manufacture similar products. Each manufacturing company wants to be ahead of all of it's counterparts. So, each company tries to advertise it's product in a unique manner so that conmsumers are attracted towards it's products. They advertising procedure is unique but the products will be some what similar. This is because, a product manufactured to meet a particular requirement has more or less the same ingredients. For example, basic ingredients of a cold cream will always be the same. So, each manufacturer has to use the same basic ingredients to manufature the cold cream. The things which can be different are the colour and odour of the cold cream, it's packing style etc. Other reasons for such pompous advertisements could be to lure the consumers to buy more and more of their products. If advertising is done in a grand way by involving a popular personality or a celebrity then that would attract more attention and will help in the increasing the sales of the product. For example, if a product is endorsed by a hollywood star, then many of his/her fans and admirers would buy the product out of their adulation towards the star.

"Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",0,1
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a really cool thing. It can detect emotions on people's faces and it's like a computer can read your mind. The article says it's like a game changer. But, I'm not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom.

First of all, it's kinda creepy. Imagine if a computer is watching you all the time and can tell what you're feeling. It's like Big Brother is always watching you. It's like you can't even have a secret. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks you're feeling sad when you're actually just tired? That could be really embarrassing.

But, on the other hand, it could be useful. If a teacher can see that a student is feeling upset, they can help them. Maybe the student is struggling with a concept and the teacher can explain it in a different way. Or maybe the student is feeling bullied and the teacher can step in and help. It's like having a superpower.

Also, it could be fun. Imagine if you could play games that use the Facial Action Coding System. You could play a game where you have to make different emotional expressions and the computer has to guess what you're feeling. It would be like a reverse version of ""Guess Who"" where the computer is trying to guess who you are.

In conclusion, I think the Facial Action Coding System is a cool technology but it's not sure if it's a good thing to use it in a classroom. It could be useful but it could also be creepy and embarrassing. But, it could also be fun. It's a hard decision and I'm not sure what I would choose. Maybe we could just use it for games and not for real life.",1,0
"Dear State Senator,

I am writting to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I think it's a good idea to keep it the way it is. I know some people think it's unfair but I don't agree.

First of all, the Electoral College makes sure that the President has to win support from a lot of different places. If we just had a popular vote, the President would only have to worry about the biggest states and the people in the smaller states would get ignored. This way, the President has to care about everyone.

Another thing is that the Electoral College helps to keep the country together. If we didn't have it, the President would just be chosen by the most populous states and the other states would feel left out. This way, everyone gets a say.

I know some people say that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it means that the President can win without getting the most votes. But, as the article we read in class said, that's not always true. In fact, it's only happened a few times in history. And when it does happen, it's usually because the election is really close and the Electoral College helps to make sure that the President is chosen fairly.

I also want to say that changing to a popular vote system would be hard to do. It would take a lot of work and it might even cause some problems. For example, the article we read said that some states might try to rig the election by giving their electoral votes to the candidate they like the most, even if the people in that state didn't vote for them.

So, I think it's best to keep the Electoral College the way it is. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And it's been around for a long time, so it must be doing something right.

Thank you for listening to my opinion. I hope you will consider what I said when you're making your decision.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,0
"Do you think its a good idea for computer to be abel to read our emotions? Some peoples might say yes, but i think its a bad idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can read peoples emotions by looking at there face. Its like a computer can see how you feel. But what if you don't want it to know how you feel? What if you don't want people to no your secrets?

In the article it says that this technology can be used in a classroom to help teacher know if there students are understanding the material or not. But what if the student don't want to show there face? What if there shy or don't want to get caught not paying attention?

I think that this technology is a invasion of privacy. Its like the computer is watching you all the time. And what if the computer gets it wrong? What if it thinks your happy when your really sad? Or what if it thinks your sad when your really happy?

I know some people might say that it will help teacher to help there students. But i think its not worth it. Its not worth giving up our privacy. We should have the right to keep our emotions to our self.

In conclusion, i think the use of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is not valuable. Its an invasion of privacy and could potently be misleading. We should focus on other ways to help students and teachers connect, like having real conversations and building realationships.",1,0
"Every afternoon hundreds of thousands of youths flood Internet cafes, switch on a game console, or otherwise sit down to involve themselves in intense fantasy words. Some of them play games for hours on end, while others play them for only a few minutes at a time. What do you think? Do you agree with the statement that ""playing video games is bad for children""? If you answered ""yes"", then you are not alone. In fact, the majority of people in the United States believe that video game playing is harmful to children, according to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The survey, which was conducted in June and July of this year, asked a representative sample of 1,002 adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia about their views on the effects of video gaming on young people. Of the respondents, 63% said that playing video or computer game is ""bad for kids."" The percentage of respondents who agreed with this statement was higher among men (69%) than among women (57%). The majority (56%) of those who said video and computer gaming was harmful also said it was ""very"" or ""somewhat"" harmful, compared with 39% of the people who did not believe this to be the case.

The survey also asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with a number of other statements, including the following: ""Video games can be fun, but they can also be a distraction from real-life problems""; ""I think it's important for parents to talk to their children about the dangers of playing games""; and ""Parents should teach children how to control their use of computers and other electronic devices."" In response to the last question, a plurality (44%) agreed that parents should ""teach children to use their devices responsibly,"" while a third (33%) said they should not. When it came to teaching children not to play computer and game games, however, more people agreed than disagreed (45% vs. 33%).

It helps them to be more fair.

Also, the Electoral College is in the Constitution! It's been there since the beginning, so it must be important. If we change it now, it would be like we're saying the founding fathers were wrong. They must have put it in there for a reason.

I know some people say that it's not fair because sometimes the person who wins the popular vote doesn't win the election. But that's not always true! Sometimes the person who wins the popular vote does win the election. It's not like it never happens. And besides, like I said before, the Electoral College makes sure the president has to worry about everyone, not just the people who voted for them.
