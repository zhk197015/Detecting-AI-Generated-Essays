"Media scrutiny is pervasive in our modern age, and there can be no doubt that it has changed how people view public figures. In the past, a person could be considered a hero by their society without being subject to the intense scrutiny of the press. Today, however, it is difficult for a society to view any individual as a hero if they are in the public eye, given that the media often finds fault in even the most admirable of individuals. While I agree that media scrutiny has made it difficult for a society to view anyone as an unassailable hero, I do not think that it is completely impossible.

In the past, heroes were typically individuals who displayed extraordinary physical or moral courage in service of their community. While the press may have still reported on their actions, the intense scrutiny that is prevalent today was not as common. This meant that people could view these individuals as heroes without their public image being tarnished by a journalistic investigation of their private lives. It is this type of hero – those who demonstrate exceptional courage or virtue – that is difficult to come by in today’s society.

The intense scrutiny of the press, combined with the 24-hour news cycle, has made it increasingly difficult for a society to regard any individual as a hero. A seemingly heroic individual can quickly be revealed to have made a mistake or have some sort of skeleton in their closet. The press is quick to expose any potentially damaging information about a public figure, and the public is even quicker to judge. This heightened scrutiny, combined with the public’s eagerness to jump to conclusions, makes it difficult for any person to maintain a heroic status, even if they have done nothing wrong.

Despite the difficulties posed by media scrutiny, I do not think that it is completely impossible for a society to view any person as a hero. It is still possible for someone to rise above the media’s attempts to find fault and be regarded as a hero. An example of this is the late President Nelson Mandela. Despite being subject to intense scrutiny during his lifetime, he was still able to maintain his status as a hero to his people. This is because he consistently displayed courage and virtue in the face of adversity and was willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of his community. This is a testament to the fact that, even in an age of intense media scrutiny, it is still possible for an individual to be viewed as a hero.

In conclusion, it is true that the intense scrutiny of the press and the 24-hour news cycle have made it difficult for a society to regard any individual as a hero. However, I do not believe that this is an impossible task. It is still possible for someone to demonstrate exceptional courage and virtue and become a hero in the eyes of their society.
