Given the extensive number of models we have established, it is impractical to consolidate all instructions into a single README file.

Instead, we provide a comprehensive, step-by-step README file for each implemented model. To understand how to run a specific script, please refer to the corresponding .md file.

For example:
- To learn how to run evaluate.py, refer to evaluate.md.
- To understand how to execute simple-baseline.py, refer to simple-baseline.md.
